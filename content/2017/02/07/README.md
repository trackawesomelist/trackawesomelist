## [7. Awesome Courses](/content/prakhar1989/awesome-courses/README.md)

### Courses / Systems

*   [CSEP 552](http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/csep552/16wi/) **Distributed Systems** *University of Washington* <img src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4f9.png" width="20" height="20" alt="Lecture Videos" title="Lecture Videos" /> <img src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4bb.png" width="20" height="20" alt="Assignments" title="Assignments" /> <img src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4dd.png" width="20" height="20" alt="Lecture Notes" title="Lecture Notes" />
    *   CSEP552 is a graduate course on distributed systems. Distributed systems have become central to many aspects of how computers are used, from web applications to e-commerce to content distribution. This course will cover abstractions and implementation techniques for the construction of distributed systems, including client server computing, the web, cloud computing, peer-to-peer systems, and distributed storage systems. Topics will include remote procedure call, maintaining consistency of distributed state, fault tolerance, high availability, and other topics. As we believe the best way to learn the material is to build it, there will be a series of hands-on programming projects.
    *   [Lectures](http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/csep552/13sp/video/) of a previous session are available to watch.

### Courses / Machine Learning

*   [DEEPNLP](https://github.com/oxford-cs-deepnlp-2017/) **Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing** *University of Oxford* <img src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4bb.png" width="20" height="20" alt="Assignments" title="Assignments" /> <img src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4dd.png" width="20" height="20" alt="Lecture Notes" title="Lecture Notes" />
    *   This is an applied course focussing on recent advances in analysing and generating speech and text using recurrent neural networks. We introduce the mathematical definitions of the relevant machine learning models and derive their associated optimisation algorithms. The course covers a range of applications of neural networks in NLP including analysing latent dimensions in text, transcribing speech to text, translating between languages, and answering questions. This course is organised by Phil Blunsom and delivered in partnership with the **DeepMind Natural Language Research Group**.
