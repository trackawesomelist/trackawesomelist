*   [Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act](https://energyinnovationact.org/) - The Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act (H.R. 763) will drive down America's carbon pollution and bring climate change under control, while unleashing American technology innovation and ingenuity. This policy was also introduced in the Senate in 2018 as S. 3791.
*   [No Fracking in Alaska‚Äôs Arctic Wildlife Refuge](https://act.nrdc.org/letter/welcome-arctic-190603) - Alaska‚Äôs Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is one of our last truly wild places ‚Äî and it has been off-limits to oil companies for decades.

Now a misguided plan to feed the starving whales with hatchery salmon will push both endangered species closer to the edge, while costing taxpayers millions of dollars per year.
    Tell NOAA Regional Administrator Barry Thom, WDFW Director Kelly Susewind, and our elected decision makers to stop wasting money on failed plans and invest in science-based solutions: reduce hatchery production, remove dams and change how we harvest salmon.
*   [U.K. Double Tree Cover](https://act.friendsoftheearth.uk/petition/tell-uk-government-double-tree-cover) - Over the centuries the United Kingdom has cleared its forests, leaving it with some of the lowest levels of woodland in Europe.

*   [U.S. Save the "Clean Power Plan"](https://www.nrdc.org/save-clean-power-plan) - Fossil-fueled power plants are responsible for nearly 40 percent of America‚Äôs carbon footprint. The Clean Power Plan calls for setting limits on this climate-warming pollution from these power plants, specifically at least 32 percent by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. By 2030, the Clean Power Plan could save the United States $20 billion in climate-related costs and deliver up to $34 billion in health benefits.
*   [UK Government: Act now on the Climate Emergency](https://secure.greenpeace.org.uk/page/s/declare-climate-emergency) - Now that Parliament has declared a Climate Emergency, we need you to act like it. For starters, that means banning all new oil and gas production in the UK, including fracking, tripling renewable energy by 2030, planting 700 million trees, introducing a Frequent Flyer Tax, ending the sale of all new petrol and diesel cars by 2030, and more.
