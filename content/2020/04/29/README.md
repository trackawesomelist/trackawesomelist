### Building Teams

*   [What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html) - “Google's data indicated that psychological safety, more than anything else, was critical to making a team work. (…) The behaviors that create psychological safety — conversational turn-taking and empathy — are part of the same unwritten rules we often turn to, as individuals, when we need to establish a bond.”
*   [Paper we love: Software Engineering Organizations (⭐65k)](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/tree/master/software_engineering_orgs) - “The practice of software engineering, and its history is, itself, a complex study in humanity, coordination, and communication.”
*   [Developer Tropes: "Google does it"](https://tomaytotomato.com/developer-tropes-2/) - It's [cargo-cultish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult) to imitate the big names in our industry as a path to success. Instead, the take home from this article “would be that managers and other leaders should be like ecologists; who measure, observe and nurture their ecosystems. Doing so will help build a unique workplace that will yield great results.”

### Roles / Executives

*   [Narcissistic CEOs Weaken Collaboration and Integrity](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/narcissistic-ceos-weaken-collaboration-integrity) - “The prototypic visionary leader profile is so similar to that of a narcissist, if boards aren't careful, they're going to end up choosing people who are narcissistic as CEOs”.
*   “Hiring isn't the challenge. The challenge is finding people who can be effective while working for executives whose only qualifications and training are narcissistic levels of self confidence.” ([source](https://twitter.com/kellan/status/1205113384632500224)).

### Roles / CTO & VP of Engineering

*   [Want to Know the Difference Between a CTO and a VP Engineering?](https://bothsidesofthetable.com/want-to-know-the-difference-between-a-cto-and-a-vp-engineering-4fc3750c596b) - Another way to look at thing: placing these roles along the “Process Orientation” and “Technical Capability” quadrants.
*   [“That's usually about the time I nope right out of the interview”](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19188246) - Bad signs of a CTO trying to recruit an engineering manager, or the perils of not believing in hierarchies.

### Roles / Engineering Managers

*   [What are the signs that you have a great manager?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20230133) - “The irony is that you don't really notice a great manager.”

### Roles / Engineers

*   [Programmer Moneyball: Challenging the Myth of Individual Programmer Productivity](https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/sei_blog/2020/01/programmer-moneyball-challenging-the-myth-of-individual-programmer-productivity.html) - “Since software project managers have limited ability to evaluate individual developer capability, they should rely on a productive environment and developing talent.”
*   “10x developers (…) rapidly become 1x developers (or worse) if you don't let them make their own architectural choices” ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5496914)).

*   [All the best engineering advice I stole from non-technical people](https://medium.com/@bellmar/all-the-best-engineering-advice-i-stole-from-non-technical-people-eb7f90ca2f5f) - “It's intriguing that the stuff that really seems to make a difference in the quality of software never seems to be about software.”

### Roles / Consultants

*   “A consultant is someone 4 pages ahead in the manual” ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20786286)).
*   “The value that most orgs get from a consultant (…) is the political cover to make changes they knew they should make all along, but didn't have the social capital or the focus to make those changes” ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21714791)). And that's the reason bureaucracies and highly political organizations are fertile grounds for consultants.

### Recruitment / Hiring Process

*   [Open Sourced Interview Process (⭐359)](https://github.com/cockroachlabs/open-sourced-interview-process) - Cockroach Labs published their process “to create familiarity for candidates and account for bias, resulting in a better candidate experience and hiring decisions.”
*   [Rethinking the Hiring Process](https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/rethinking-hiring) - “Testing programmers at something they aren't actually expected to be good at and expecting to learn something about how they would work at your company is delusional, and I think these kind of interviews only serve to make the hiring team feel smarter and ensure better outcomes for engineers with traditional CS backgrounds.”

### Recruitment / Coding Challenge

*   [Fizz Buzz Test](https://wiki.c2.com/?FizzBuzzTest) - “Designed to help filter out the 99.5% of programming job candidates who can't seem to program their way out of a wet paper bag.”

### Recruitment / Negotiation

*   [How Not to Bomb Your Offer Negotiation](https://haseebq.com/how-not-to-bomb-your-offer-negotiation/) - “A good negotiator is empathetic and collaborative. They don't try to control you or issue ultimatums. Rather, they try to think creatively about how to fulfill both your and their needs.”

### Motivation / Negotiation

*   Reflecting on the postulates above, [Bryan Cantrill defines that the role of management](https://twitter.com/bcantrill/status/1216491615264489473?s=20) “is in constructing that environment, not micromanaging it. If engineering performance is suffering, it's (likely) a management problem: wrong problem, wrong mission, or wrong team -- or all three.”

### Motivation / Procrastination

*   [Why procrastination is about managing emotions, not time](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200121-why-procrastination-is-about-managing-emotions-not-time) - “Research shows that once the first step is made towards a task, following through becomes easier”.

### Culture / Procrastination

*   [The IT revolution and southern Europe's two lost decades](https://voxeu.org/article/it-revolution-and-southern-europes-two-lost-decades) - If you still doubt management culture could make or break an industry: “inefficient management practices have kept southern European firms from taking full advantage of the IT revolution”.
*   [It's Not Enough to Be Right—You Also Have to Be Kind](https://forge.medium.com/its-not-enough-to-be-right-you-also-have-to-be-kind-b8814111fe1) - “It's harder to be kind than clever”, or put another way by Abraham Joshua Heschel: “When I was young, I used to admire intelligent people; as I grow older, I admire kind people.”
*   “It is not your job to protect people (particularly senior management) from the consequences of their decisions. Make your decisions in your own best interest; it is up to the organization to make sure that your interest aligns with theirs.” ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7179946)).
*   “If you cannot disrupt a perverted culture by introducing a new culture, the politics of the perverted culture will work against you until you break, align, or leave. It is not unwise to leave before you break and it is easier to leave before you align.” ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20914779)) - At one point, even with the most unselfish of intentions, your attempts to elevate the culture might stall. It is not fair, but it's probably the time to leave.
*   [Netflix Culture](https://www.slideshare.net/reed2001/culture-1798664) - “The actual company values, as opposed to the nice-sounding values, are shown by who gets rewarded, promoted, or let go.”

### Cognitive Tools / Explaining

*   [Locus of control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_of_control) - A framework on “the degree to which people believe that they have control over the outcome of events in their lives, as opposed to external forces beyond their control.”

### Cognitive Tools / Systems

*   [To Get Good, Go After The Metagame](https://commoncog.com/blog/to-get-good-go-after-the-metagame/) - “Every sufficiently interesting game has a metagame above it. This is the game about the game. It is often called 'the meta'. (…) The meta is what you get after you master boring fundamentals. But observing the state of the current meta often reveals what boring fundamentals you need to learn.”

### Cognitive Tools / Behavioral

*   “People make bad choices if they're mad or scared or stressed.” - [Disney's Frozen](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b5/17/97/b5179700050b96f91f63e086e053b5ee.jpg).
*   [I coached CEOs, founders, VCs and other executive: These are the biggest takeaways](https://leowid.com/2019-2) - Excerpt: “We're all just big, complicated bags of emotion walking around; Power comes with the ability to receive a No; Learning to manage your focus, not your time.”
*   [Intellectual Humility Cheat Sheet](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/53419b80e4b0cccdfc3bbcf8/1579371627532-SANUEQ1REPX09L8NE1XM/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kI9Q46LYBJG1wKj9b7EvhSB7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QHyNOqBUUEtDDsRWrJLTmWp-RWlGnWD_Yv5axNBE_gjfhPXbI2t7MOi3WVleCqN9URFC-c33mY-I6dtTBVWXC/ih-cheat-sheet-v2.jpg) - “is about being open and able to change your mind about important things, and being able to discern when you should.”

*   [Team Leader Venn Diagram](https://larahogan.me/blog/team-leader-venn-diagram/) - “A tool for gaining a shared understanding of responsibilities”.
*   [OpenTeams](https://openteam.info) - “Teams can visualize their network of interactions, and also, cross this data with information on a teams demographic, professional, and psychological characteristics.” As manager, make sure these metrics bring positive outcome to the team. It is easy to have them instrumentalized for political reasons.
