## [34. Awesome Engineering Team Management](/content/kdeldycke/awesome-engineering-team-management/week/README.md)

### Engineering to Management Transition

*   “It is a job where your goal is to try disappoint people most slowly.” ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18222488)).

### Building Teams

*   [What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html) - “Google's data indicated that psychological safety, more than anything else, was critical to making a team work. (…) The behaviors that create psychological safety — conversational turn-taking and empathy — are part of the same unwritten rules we often turn to, as individuals, when we need to establish a bond.”
*   [Paper we love: Software Engineering Organizations (⭐85k)](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/tree/master/software_engineering_orgs) - “The practice of software engineering, and its history is, itself, a complex study in humanity, coordination, and communication.”
*   [Developer Tropes: "Google does it"](https://tomaytotomato.com/developer-tropes-2/) - It's [cargo-cultish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult) to imitate the big names in our industry as a path to success. Instead, the take home from this article “would be that managers and other leaders should be like ecologists; who measure, observe and nurture their ecosystems. Doing so will help build a unique workplace that will yield great results.”

### Roles / Executives

*   [Narcissistic CEOs Weaken Collaboration and Integrity](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/narcissistic-ceos-weaken-collaboration-integrity) - “The prototypic visionary leader profile is so similar to that of a narcissist, if boards aren't careful, they're going to end up choosing people who are narcissistic as CEOs”.
*   “Hiring isn't the challenge. The challenge is finding people who can be effective while working for executives whose only qualifications and training are narcissistic levels of self confidence.” ([source](https://twitter.com/kellan/status/1205113384632500224)).

### Roles / CTO & VP of Engineering

*   [Want to Know the Difference Between a CTO and a VP Engineering?](https://bothsidesofthetable.com/want-to-know-the-difference-between-a-cto-and-a-vp-engineering-4fc3750c596b) - Another way to look at thing: placing these roles along the “Process Orientation” and “Technical Capability” quadrants.
*   [“That's usually about the time I nope right out of the interview”](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19188246) - Bad signs of a CTO trying to recruit an engineering manager, or the perils of not believing in hierarchies.

### Roles / Engineering Managers

*   [What are the signs that you have a great manager?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20230133) - “The irony is that you don't really notice a great manager.”

### Roles / Engineers

*   [Programmer Moneyball: Challenging the Myth of Individual Programmer Productivity](https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/sei_blog/2020/01/programmer-moneyball-challenging-the-myth-of-individual-programmer-productivity.html) - “Since software project managers have limited ability to evaluate individual developer capability, they should rely on a productive environment and developing talent.”
*   “10x developers (…) rapidly become 1x developers (or worse) if you don't let them make their own architectural choices” ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5496914)).
*   [Things I Learnt from a Senior Software Engineer](https://neilkakkar.com/things-I-learnt-from-a-senior-dev.html) - “I sat next to a senior software engineer for a year. Here's what I learnt.”
*   [5 Things I've Learned in 20 Years of Programming](https://daedtech.com/5-things-ive-learned-in-20-years-of-programming/) - “A programmer with 5 years of experienced has more industry tenure than half of the entire industry.” Also see this follow-up comment of [10 things I've learned after 35 years](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21612990).
*   [All the best engineering advice I stole from non-technical people](https://medium.com/@bellmar/all-the-best-engineering-advice-i-stole-from-non-technical-people-eb7f90ca2f5f) - “It's intriguing that the stuff that really seems to make a difference in the quality of software never seems to be about software.”

### Roles / Consultants

*   “A consultant is someone 4 pages ahead in the manual” ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20786286)).
*   “The value that most orgs get from a consultant (…) is the political cover to make changes they knew they should make all along, but didn't have the social capital or the focus to make those changes” ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21714791)). And that's the reason bureaucracies and highly political organizations are fertile grounds for consultants.

### Recruitment / Hiring Process

*   [Open Sourced Interview Process (⭐409)](https://github.com/cockroachlabs/open-sourced-interview-process) - Cockroach Labs published their process “to create familiarity for candidates and account for bias, resulting in a better candidate experience and hiring decisions.”
*   [Rethinking the Hiring Process](https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/rethinking-hiring) - “Testing programmers at something they aren't actually expected to be good at and expecting to learn something about how they would work at your company is delusional, and I think these kind of interviews only serve to make the hiring team feel smarter and ensure better outcomes for engineers with traditional CS backgrounds.”

### Recruitment / Coding Challenge

*   [Fizz Buzz Test](https://wiki.c2.com/?FizzBuzzTest) - “Designed to help filter out the 99.5% of programming job candidates who can't seem to program their way out of a wet paper bag.”

### Recruitment / Negotiation

*   [How Not to Bomb Your Offer Negotiation](https://haseebq.com/how-not-to-bomb-your-offer-negotiation/) - “A good negotiator is empathetic and collaborative. They don't try to control you or issue ultimatums. Rather, they try to think creatively about how to fulfill both your and their needs.”

### Motivation / Negotiation

*   Reflecting on the postulates above, [Bryan Cantrill defines that the role of management](https://twitter.com/bcantrill/status/1216491615264489473?s=20) “is in constructing that environment, not micromanaging it. If engineering performance is suffering, it's (likely) a management problem: wrong problem, wrong mission, or wrong team -- or all three.”

### Motivation / Procrastination

*   [Why procrastination is about managing emotions, not time](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200121-why-procrastination-is-about-managing-emotions-not-time) - “Research shows that once the first step is made towards a task, following through becomes easier”.

### Culture / Procrastination

*   [The IT revolution and southern Europe's two lost decades](https://voxeu.org/article/it-revolution-and-southern-europes-two-lost-decades) - If you still doubt management culture could make or break an industry: “inefficient management practices have kept southern European firms from taking full advantage of the IT revolution”.
*   [It's Not Enough to Be Right—You Also Have to Be Kind](https://forge.medium.com/its-not-enough-to-be-right-you-also-have-to-be-kind-b8814111fe1) - “It's harder to be kind than clever”, or put another way by Abraham Joshua Heschel: “When I was young, I used to admire intelligent people; as I grow older, I admire kind people.”
*   “It is not your job to protect people (particularly senior management) from the consequences of their decisions. Make your decisions in your own best interest; it is up to the organization to make sure that your interest aligns with theirs.” ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7179946)).
*   “If you cannot disrupt a perverted culture by introducing a new culture, the politics of the perverted culture will work against you until you break, align, or leave. It is not unwise to leave before you break and it is easier to leave before you align.” ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20914779)) - At one point, even with the most unselfish of intentions, your attempts to elevate the culture might stall. It is not fair, but it's probably the time to leave.
*   [Netflix Culture](https://www.slideshare.net/reed2001/culture-1798664) - “The actual company values, as opposed to the nice-sounding values, are shown by who gets rewarded, promoted, or let go.”

### Cognitive Tools / Explaining

*   [Locus of control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_of_control) - A framework on “the degree to which people believe that they have control over the outcome of events in their lives, as opposed to external forces beyond their control.”

### Cognitive Tools / Systems

*   [To Get Good, Go After The Metagame](https://commoncog.com/blog/to-get-good-go-after-the-metagame/) - “Every sufficiently interesting game has a metagame above it. This is the game about the game. It is often called 'the meta'. (…) The meta is what you get after you master boring fundamentals. But observing the state of the current meta often reveals what boring fundamentals you need to learn.”

### Cognitive Tools / Behavioral

*   “People make bad choices if they're mad or scared or stressed.” - [Disney's Frozen](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b5/17/97/b5179700050b96f91f63e086e053b5ee.jpg).
*   [I coached CEOs, founders, VCs and other executive: These are the biggest takeaways](https://leowid.com/2019-2) - Excerpt: “We're all just big, complicated bags of emotion walking around; Power comes with the ability to receive a No; Learning to manage your focus, not your time.”

### Team Dynamics / Behavioral

*   [How to Celebrate the Small Wins](https://medium.dave-bailey.com/how-to-celebrate-the-small-wins-4a03004a1816) - My takeaway: “Celebrating Slow Progress; Hunt for Key Milestones”.
*   [Team Leader Venn Diagram](https://larahogan.me/blog/team-leader-venn-diagram/) - “A tool for gaining a shared understanding of responsibilities”.
*   [OpenTeams](https://openteam.info) - “Teams can visualize their network of interactions, and also, cross this data with information on a teams demographic, professional, and psychological characteristics.” As manager, make sure these metrics bring positive outcome to the team. It is easy to have them instrumentalized for political reasons.

### Engineering / Systems Complexity

*   [Second-system effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-system_effect) - “Tendency of small, elegant, and successful systems, to be succeeded by over-engineered, bloated systems”.

### Engineering / Technology

*   [Choose Boring Technology](http://boringtechnology.club) - “Boring, in the sense that it's well understood.”

### Engineering / Engineering Practices

*   [Code reviews at Google (⭐20k)](https://github.com/google/eng-practices/blob/master/review/reviewer/speed.md#why-should-code-reviews-be-fast-why) - “Why Should Code Reviews Be Fast? (…) To optimize for the speed at which a team of developers can produce a product together, as opposed to optimizing for the speed at which an individual developer can write code.”

### Engineering / Technical Debt

*   [Technical Debt Is Like Tetris](https://medium.com/s/story/technical-debt-is-like-tetris-168f64d8b700) - Another way to explain technical debt: “Scenarios like these create technical debt within the product code. A buried gap in Tetris represents technical debt. (…) Paying down technical debt keeps you competitive. It keeps you in the game.”

### Remote Work / Technical Debt

*   [GitLab's Guide to All-Remote](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/guide/) - “GitLab is the world's largest all-remote company”. Here is what it means and how it works.
*   [Asynchronous Communication: The Real Reason Remote Workers Are More Productive](https://doist.com/blog/asynchronous-communication/) - “Remote workers are more productive than their office-bound counterparts.”

### Meetings / 1 on 1

*   “1on1s are the managers Swiss army knife” ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22341739)) - Another advice from the source: make them walk'n'talks.

### Facilities / Standups

*   [The Elves Leave Middle Earth – Sodas Are No Longer Free](https://steveblank.com/2009/12/21/the-elves-leave-middle-earth-%E2%80%93-soda%E2%80%99s-are-no-longer-free/) - Company stopped providing free soda. The engineers were very upset, but it was just soda and they could afford it. But really it wasn't soda. Soda was the canary in the coal mine, triggering an exodus of its best engineers.

### Product Management / Standups

*   “You're the broker for a lot of unstructured information and have to fend off all kinds of disruptive influences to land even close to where you're trying to go.” ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19050555))

### Product Management / Product-Market Fit

*   [David Rusenko - How To Find Product Market Fit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LNQxT9LvM0) - “Details the story of how Weebly developed one of the most popular website creation and hosting sites on the web today.”

### Product Management / Product Strategy

*   [“Why does the tire company rate restaurants”](https://mobile.twitter.com/trevmckendrick/status/1218748974321954816) - A great example on why you should investigate complementary businesses.
*   [Osborne effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osborne_effect) - “A social phenomenon of customers canceling or deferring orders for the current soon-to-be-obsolete product as an unexpected drawback of a company's announcing a future product prematurely.” This is the price to pay for hasty marketing actions.

### Project Management / Specifications

*   [Requirements volatility is the core problem of software engineering](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/02/20/requirements-volatility-is-the-core-problem-of-software-engineering/) - “Start by accepting that change is inevitable. (…) As a consequence of this, software is never finished, only abandoned. (…) This means that no software product is ever exactly, perfectly satisfactory.”

### Agile / Tickets

*   “The fundamental problem that drives most agile failures isn't in the team's execution, it's in the business' expectations. One side is signed up for incremental delivery, and one side is set up for a fixed scope and deadline and the result is misery.” ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20326074))

### Objectives and Key Results (OKR) / Tickets

*   “One way in which I've seen OKRs used effectively is as a defense against the type of middle or upper manager who is constantly coming up with new ideas or tasks.” ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19550614)) - Or how OKRs can be weaponized to prevent top managers to mess with the (already established) schedule.

### Training / Tickets

*   [What Medieval People Got Right About Learning](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2019/06/07/apprenticeships/) - “Why apprenticeships beat classrooms”.

### Communication / Knowledge

*   [What senior engineers do: fix knowledge holes](http://www.mooreds.com/wordpress/archives/3232) - “This is the textbook definition of a senior engineer. You see a problem, you solve it (thoroughly), you document it and you level up your team.”
*   [Chesterton's fence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Chesterton%27s_fence) - “If you're considering nominating something for deletion, or changing a policy, because it doesn't appear to have any use or purpose, research its history first.” It's not we'd like to play conservative here, but because we need to fix the knowledge hole as described above.
*   [You're Not Managing a Team of Software Engineers, You're Managing a Team of Writers](https://medium.com/coaching-notes/youre-not-managing-a-team-of-software-engineers-you-re-managing-a-team-of-writers-b263d3a10cc7) - Because writing software is “a creative process which is by its nature unpredictable and personal, in an environment which craves certainty, predictability and consistency.”

### Communication / Writing

*   [The Baldwin Formula for scientific writing: writing papers and reviews](https://www.ice.mpg.de/ext/fileadmin/extranet/dept_itb/The_Baldwin_Formula_for_writing_a_scientific_paper_and_reviewing_papers.pdf) - “The most efficient way to write scientific papers is to write while you are still conducting experiments”.
*   [Ten simple rules for getting started on Twitter as a scientist](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007513) - Twitter “can be used in a much more active, collaborative way: to ask for advice, to form new bonds and scientific collaborations, to announce jobs and find employees, to find new mentors and jobs.”

### Communication / Style

*   [BLUF: The Military Standard That Can Make Your Writing More Powerful](https://www.animalz.co/blog/bottom-line-up-front/) - “BLUF is a military communications acronym—it stands for “bottom line up front”—that's designed to enforce speed and clarity in reports and emails.”
*   [`proselint`](https://github.com/amperser/proselint/) - Places the world's greatest writers and editors by your side, where they whisper suggestions on how to improve your prose.
*   [alex (⭐4.8k)](https://github.com/get-alex/alex) - Whether your own or someone else's writing, alex helps you find gender favoring, polarizing, race related, religion inconsiderate, or other unequal phrasing in text.

### Compensation / Equity

*   “Never accept a lower salary in exchange for equity.” ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21868845))
*   “Public RSUs for stock you can sell immediately on the open market are fantastic.” ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22386728)).

### Politics / Equity

*   [Selectorate theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selectorate_theory) - “In selectorate theory, three groups of people affect leaders. These groups are the nominal selectorate, the real selectorate, and the winning coalition. (…) To remain in power, leaders must maintain their winning coalition.”
*   “Playing the game well is now front and center” ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21925738)), or why the [key practices for achieving large professional goals](https://nodramadevops.com/2019/12/key-practices-for-achieving-large-professional-goals/) is missing the parts about office politics.
*   [“Company I've worked for had manager who tried to ship features over the weekend with a ragtag team of developers who don't understand why that's a bad idea.”](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22285123) - Tactics of hustling managers, and how the company reacting to that kind of manager makes or break a good place to work.
*   “The actual power wielded by a high level executive is usually inversely proportional to the size of the organization they manage.” (source: [comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20260498) on [Why large companies are so difficult to rescue](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20260114)).
*   “Cutting costs gets you a raise. Delivering a big project is a path to promotion.” ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21230771))
*   “You know your game fails when you read in the news about the feature you are supposed to have.” ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20220484)). A team learning about its roadmap at the same time of the general public is a sure sign something is wrong.
*   “In a highly political environment there are two ways to create change, one is through overt manipulation, which is to collect political power to yourself and then exert it to enact change, and the other is covert manipulation, which is to enact change subtly enough that the political organism doesn't react. (sometimes called "triggering the antibodies").” ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5541517)).
*   “It's common to promote someone to just get rid of that person :) Sometimes promoting is just easier that firing.” ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21767734)).

### Re-organizations / Team-level

*   “This is the managerialist dream. To replace employees' judgement and competence with a process and management methodology. (…) It never works.” ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20881308)). And why the retraining answer above is the best one.

### Re-organizations / Company-level

*   [An Alternative Approach to Re-Orgs At Your Company](https://caseyaccidental.com/alternative-approach-re-orgs/) - “Trying not to repeat re-org mistakes, we started working on a structure that would make the re-org act like a feedback-fueled progress driven by the teams instead of by people above them.” This is an attempt to extract from the ground up signals pointing to inadequate structure. My cautionary tale: this might only work up to a point depending on the company's culture.
*   “When everything is great success, people behind that success shadow the people who could make success in the future. (…) Netflix is great example of how to do big transition right. Netflix was in renting DVDs by mail business. When the decision to move to streaming was made, Netflix CEO did not allow managers who responsible for DVD renting business into meetings where the future was planned.” ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21395557)).
*   [Speaking Truth to Power: Reflections on My Career at Microsoft](https://onezero.medium.com/speaking-truth-to-power-reflections-on-a-career-at-microsoft-90f80a449e36) - After 3 decades in a deeply flawed company, the author comes to a humble conclusion: leaders should embodies the value of their employees. Not the other way around. “Changes at the top — not speeches, training or hashtags — make the most cultural impact. If you want real and lasting cultural change, sweep away the made-men who succeeded under the previous culture and promote the people who look, act, and think more like their employees than their managers.”

### Health / Stress

*   [The Toxic Handler: Organizational Hero — and Casualty](https://www.companiesalive.com/toxichandlers-healthandhealing-lifecoaching-miami-leadershiptraining.htm) - “toxic handler, a manager who voluntarily shoulders the sadness, frustration, bitterness, and anger that are endemic to organizational life. Although toxic handlers may be found at every level in organizations, many work near the top”.
*   [Manager Energy Drain](https://larahogan.me/blog/manager-energy-drain/) - “How do I handle how tired I am as a manager? 1. Defrag your calendar; 2. Delegate messy and unscoped projects; 3. Say no.”

### Health / Burnout
