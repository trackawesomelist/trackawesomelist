### Engineering to Management Transition

*   ‚ÄúIt is a job where your goal is to try disappoint people most slowly.‚Äù ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18222488)).

### Building Teams

*   [What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html) - ‚ÄúGoogle's data indicated that psychological safety, more than anything else, was critical to making a team work. (‚Ä¶) The behaviors that create psychological safety ‚Äî conversational turn-taking and empathy ‚Äî are part of the same unwritten rules we often turn to, as individuals, when we need to establish a bond.‚Äù
*   [Paper we love: Software Engineering Organizations (‚≠ê88k)](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/tree/master/software_engineering_orgs) - ‚ÄúThe practice of software engineering, and its history is, itself, a complex study in humanity, coordination, and communication.‚Äù
*   [Developer Tropes: "Google does it"](https://tomaytotomato.com/developer-tropes-2/) - It's [cargo-cultish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult) to imitate the big names in our industry as a path to success. Instead, the take home from this article ‚Äúwould be that managers and other leaders should be like ecologists; who measure, observe and nurture their ecosystems. Doing so will help build a unique workplace that will yield great results.‚Äù

### Roles / Executives

*   [Narcissistic CEOs Weaken Collaboration and Integrity](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/narcissistic-ceos-weaken-collaboration-integrity) - ‚ÄúThe prototypic visionary leader profile is so similar to that of a narcissist, if boards aren't careful, they're going to end up choosing people who are narcissistic as CEOs‚Äù.
*   ‚ÄúHiring isn't the challenge. The challenge is finding people who can be effective while working for executives whose only qualifications and training are narcissistic levels of self confidence.‚Äù ([source](https://twitter.com/kellan/status/1205113384632500224)).

### Roles / CTO & VP of Engineering

*   [Want to Know the Difference Between a CTO and a VP Engineering?](https://bothsidesofthetable.com/want-to-know-the-difference-between-a-cto-and-a-vp-engineering-4fc3750c596b) - Another way to look at thing: placing these roles along the ‚ÄúProcess Orientation‚Äù and ‚ÄúTechnical Capability‚Äù quadrants.
*   [‚ÄúThat's usually about the time I nope right out of the interview‚Äù](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19188246) - Bad signs of a CTO trying to recruit an engineering manager, or the perils of not believing in hierarchies.

*   [What are the signs that you have a great manager?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20230133) - ‚ÄúThe irony is that you don't really notice a great manager.‚Äù

### Roles / Engineers

*   [All the best engineering advice I stole from non-technical people](https://medium.com/@bellmar/all-the-best-engineering-advice-i-stole-from-non-technical-people-eb7f90ca2f5f) - ‚ÄúIt's intriguing that the stuff that really seems to make a difference in the quality of software never seems to be about software.‚Äù

### Roles / Consultants

*   ‚ÄúA consultant is someone 4 pages ahead in the manual‚Äù ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20786286)).
*   ‚ÄúThe value that most orgs get from a consultant (‚Ä¶) is the political cover to make changes they knew they should make all along, but didn't have the social capital or the focus to make those changes‚Äù ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21714791)). And that's the reason bureaucracies and highly political organizations are fertile grounds for consultants.

### Recruitment / Hiring Process

*   [Open Sourced Interview Process (‚≠ê417)](https://github.com/cockroachlabs/open-sourced-interview-process) - Cockroach Labs published their process ‚Äúto create familiarity for candidates and account for bias, resulting in a better candidate experience and hiring decisions.‚Äù
*   [Rethinking the Hiring Process](https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/rethinking-hiring) - ‚ÄúTesting programmers at something they aren't actually expected to be good at and expecting to learn something about how they would work at your company is delusional, and I think these kind of interviews only serve to make the hiring team feel smarter and ensure better outcomes for engineers with traditional CS backgrounds.‚Äù

### Recruitment / Coding Challenge

*   [Fizz Buzz Test](https://wiki.c2.com/?FizzBuzzTest) - ‚ÄúDesigned to help filter out the 99.5% of programming job candidates who can't seem to program their way out of a wet paper bag.‚Äù

*   [How Not to Bomb Your Offer Negotiation](https://haseebq.com/how-not-to-bomb-your-offer-negotiation/) - ‚ÄúA good negotiator is empathetic and collaborative. They don't try to control you or issue ultimatums. Rather, they try to think creatively about how to fulfill both your and their needs.‚Äù

### Motivation / Negotiation

*   Reflecting on the postulates above, [Bryan Cantrill defines that the role of management](https://twitter.com/bcantrill/status/1216491615264489473?s=20) ‚Äúis in constructing that environment, not micromanaging it. If engineering performance is suffering, it's (likely) a management problem: wrong problem, wrong mission, or wrong team -- or all three.‚Äù

### Motivation / Procrastination

*   [Why procrastination is about managing emotions, not time](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200121-why-procrastination-is-about-managing-emotions-not-time) - ‚ÄúResearch shows that once the first step is made towards a task, following through becomes easier‚Äù.

*   ‚ÄúIt is not your job to protect people (particularly senior management) from the consequences of their decisions. Make your decisions in your own best interest; it is up to the organization to make sure that your interest aligns with theirs.‚Äù ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7179946)).
*   ‚ÄúIf you cannot disrupt a perverted culture by introducing a new culture, the politics of the perverted culture will work against you until you break, align, or leave. It is not unwise to leave before you break and it is easier to leave before you align.‚Äù ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20914779)) - At one point, even with the most unselfish of intentions, your attempts to elevate the culture might stall. It is not fair, but it's probably the time to leave.
*   [Netflix Culture](https://www.slideshare.net/reed2001/culture-1798664) - ‚ÄúThe actual company values, as opposed to the nice-sounding values, are shown by who gets rewarded, promoted, or let go.‚Äù

This is the game about the game. It is often called 'the meta'. (‚Ä¶) The meta is what you get after you master boring fundamentals. But observing the state of the current meta often reveals what boring fundamentals you need to learn.‚Äù

### Cognitive Tools / Behavioral

*   ‚ÄúPeople make bad choices if they're mad or scared or stressed.‚Äù - [Disney's Frozen](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b5/17/97/b5179700050b96f91f63e086e053b5ee.jpg).

### Product Management / Standups

*   ‚ÄúYou're the broker for a lot of unstructured information and have to fend off all kinds of disruptive influences to land even close to where you're trying to go.‚Äù ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19050555))

(‚Ä¶) As a consequence of this, software is never finished, only abandoned. (‚Ä¶) This means that no software product is ever exactly, perfectly satisfactory.‚Äù

### Agile / Delivery

*   ‚ÄúThe fundamental problem that drives most agile failures isn't in the team's execution, it's in the business' expectations. One side is signed up for incremental delivery, and one side is set up for a fixed scope and deadline and the result is misery.‚Äù ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20326074))

### Objectives and Key Results (OKR) / Delivery

*   ‚ÄúOne way in which I've seen OKRs used effectively is as a defense against the type of middle or upper manager who is constantly coming up with new ideas or tasks.‚Äù ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19550614)) - Or how OKRs can be weaponized to prevent top managers to mess with the (already established) schedule.

*   [You're Not Managing a Team of Software Engineers, You're Managing a Team of Writers](https://medium.com/coaching-notes/youre-not-managing-a-team-of-software-engineers-you-re-managing-a-team-of-writers-b263d3a10cc7) - Because writing software is ‚Äúa creative process which is by its nature unpredictable and personal, in an environment which craves certainty, predictability and consistency.‚Äù

*   ‚ÄúIn a highly political environment there are two ways to create change, one is through overt manipulation, which is to collect political power to yourself and then exert it to enact change, and the other is covert manipulation, which is to enact change subtly enough that the political organism doesn't react.
