### Politics

*   [US Damn Removal](https://www.change.org/t/dam-removal-en-us) - [70 percent of the dams in the United States](https://www.ussdams.org/our-news/americas-aging-dams-in-need-of-repair/) are now more than 50 years old, with almost 2,000 of them rated as "high-hazard". About [1,000 dams have failed](https://apnews.com/75b1cd657f3e4fa3be6adaf968eb7df4) over the past four decades, killing 34 people, and now many are no longer adequate to handle the intense rainfall and floods of a changing climate.
    With dams causing wild salmon populations to go extinct, their only benefit is hydropower, yet dams are woefully inefficient by modern standards. For example, the Tugalo Dam in Georgia destroyed 597 acres of temperate rainforest to produce 45 Megawatts, which is the equivalent of 7,500 homes adding 6kw rooftop solar panels. We should tear down these dams as soon as possible, be that when their contract runs out or sooner, instead of wasting tax-payer money operating them or trying to revive them.
