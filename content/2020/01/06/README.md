### Lisp Environments

*   Prepackaged environments
    *   [Portacle](https://shinmera.github.io/portacle/) - A portable and multiplatform Common Lisp environment. It ships a slightly customized Emacs with SLIME, SBCL (a popular Common Lisp implementation), Quicklisp and Git. No installation needed, so it's a very quick and easy way to get going.
    *   [Lispbox](https://common-lisp.net/project/lispbox/) - An IDE (Emacs + SLIME), Common Lisp implementation (Clozure Common Lisp) and library manager (Quicklisp), pre-packaged as archives for Windows, macOS and Linux. Descendant of "Lisp in a Box" [mentioned](http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/lather-rinse-repeat-a-tour-of-the-repl.html) in Practical Common Lisp.
    *   [Lispworks Personal Edition](http://www.lispworks.com/downloads/) - A non-Emacs based IDE for LispWorks Lisp, with some restrictions.
    *   [Allegro Common Lisp](https://franz.com/products/allegrocl/) - Has a free [Express Edition](https://franz.com/downloads/clp/survey) IDE, and [training videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN36UrxtyNBJPaG0kmBJNRw).
*   For advanced users
    *   [Articulate Common Lisp](http://articulate-lisp.com) - A HOWTO for putting together a Lisp environment, and has information on [useful libraries](http://articulate-lisp.com/project/abcs.html) and how to [structure projects](http://articulate-lisp.com/project/new-project.html).
    *   If you're an experienced [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) user, you can just install [SLIME](https://common-lisp.net/project/slime/) and a [supported Common Lisp implementation](https://common-lisp.net/project/slime/doc/html/Platforms.html#Platforms). See the [SLIME manual](https://common-lisp.net/project/slime/doc/html/) for more details.
    *   The Common Lisp Cookbook has more information about [installing an implementation](https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/getting-started.html) using an implementation manager like [Roswell (‚≠ê1.7k)](https://github.com/roswell/roswell/wiki), or on Docker.

### Online References

    *   [Cliki on CLtL2](https://cliki.net/Getting+Started) - Claims it has more useful descriptions of [LOOP](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/ai-repository/ai/html/cltl/clm/node235.html#SECTION003000000000000000000) and [FORMAT](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/ai-repository/ai/html/cltl/clm/node200.html) than the CLHS does.
    *   [Stack Overflow on CLtL2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/108537/what-are-the-main-differences-between-cltl2-and-ansi-cl) - Some recommend using CLtL2 for insight and inspiration, but to use the CLHS when programming.
    *   [A list of differences between CLtL2 and the ANSI Common Lisp specification.](http://linuxfinances.info/info/commonlisp.html#AEN9679)

### Online Books

*   [Common Lisp: A Gentle Introduction to Symbolic Computation by David S. Touretzky](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/LispBook/) - a good introduction for people new to programming. Contains code for really useful utilities like [DTRACE](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Lisp/dtrace/) and [SDRAW](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Lisp/sdraw/).
*   [Common Lisp: An interactive approach by Stuart C. Shapiro](https://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~shapiro/Commonlisp/) - A textbook that teaches mainly through the use of exercises.
*   [Practical Common Lisp by Peter Seibel](http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/) - A great introduction for experienced programmers, and tries to highlight from the very beginning what makes CL different to other languages.
*   [Common Lisp Koans (‚≠ê3k)](https://github.com/google/lisp-koans) - Not exactly a book, but a set of koans to help you learn the language.
*   [On Lisp by Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisp.html) - A great book for intermediately experienced Lispers.
*   [Let Over Lambda by Doug Hoyte](https://letoverlambda.com) - An advanced book on Lisp Macros.
    *   The first six chapters are available online.
    *   [Comments on Let Over Lambda](https://www.reddit.com/r/lisp/comments/3actsc/let_over_lambda/) - Several people recommend that you be comfortable with On Lisp before reading this book, and that the start is slow.
    *   [The chapter on closures](https://letoverlambda.com/index.cl/guest/chap2.html) - Has several non-trivial examples, and demonstrates the power of this feature.
*   [Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming by Peter Norvig (‚≠ê6.9k)](https://github.com/norvig/paip-lisp) - Has many interesting applications of Lisp, but is no longer a good reference for AI.

### Offline Books

*   [Land of Lisp by Conrad Barski, MD](http://landoflisp.com) - A fun introduction to Lisp that uses comics and has you writing games.
    *   Available as an [ebook](https://www.nostarch.com/lisp.htm).
    *   A couple of the LOOP macros are written `for x for y...` which you can change to `for x from 0 for y...` to make them work in SBCL.
    *   Has an [errata page](http://landoflisp.com/errata.html).
    *   Most of the book is entertaining and fairly easy, but gets hairy from about Chapter 18. It doesn't feel like later chapters introduce much, so I recommend switching to a different book at that point.
    *   The Web server example in Ch 13, 19 and 20 will only work on CLISP, and needs the addition of HTTP response headers to render the HTML properly.
*   [ANSI Common Lisp by Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/acl.html) - Good as a reference, covers CLOS, and has several example program implementations.
    *   Plaintext versions of [Chapter 1](http://lib.store.yahoo.net/lib/paulgraham/acl1.txt) and [Chapter 2](http://lib.store.yahoo.net/lib/paulgraham/acl2.txt) are available online.
*   [Common Lisp Recipes by Edmund Weitz](http://weitz.de/cl-recipes/) - A great set of Common Lisp patterns.
*   [Object-Oriented Programming in Common Lisp by Sonya E. Keene](https://www.amazon.com/Object-Oriented-Programming-COMMON-LISP-Programmers/dp/0201175894) - An in-depth description of the CLOS, and shows how to use it with example applications.
*   [The Art of the Metaobject Protocol by Gregor Kiczales, Jim des Rivieres, and Daniel G. Bobrow](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Metaobject-Protocol-Gregor-Kiczales/dp/0262610744/) - Describes the CLOS Metaobject Protocol (MOP).
    *   [Chapters 5 and 6 (available online)](http://metamodular.com/CLOS-MOP/) - The specification of a metaobject protocol extension to CLOS, by Robert Strandh.
        *   Superseded by the [modern public domain CLOS MOP specification](https://clos-mop.hexstreamsoft.com/) by Jean-Philippe Paradis ([Hexstream](https://github.com/Hexstream)).
