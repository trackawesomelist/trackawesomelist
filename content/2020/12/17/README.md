## [12. Awesome Codepoints](/content/Codepoints/awesome-codepoints/README.md)

### Code Points that Affect Others

*   The [Regional Indicator Symbols](https://codepoints.net/U+1F1E6..U+1F1FF)
    U+1F1E6 to U+1F1FF resemble the 26 latin characters. They are used to
    create flag emoji. Since the Unicode consortium didn’t feel like getting on
    board with international politics, the solution to flags is to combine
    these 26 characters to the respective ISO code for a country. Examples:

    | Country | ISO Code | Code Points       | Emoji (if supported) |
    | ------- | -------- | ----------------- | -------------------- |
    | USA     | US       | U+1F1FA + U+1F1F8 |                    |
    | Germany | DE       | U+1F1E9 + U+1F1EA |                    |
    | China   | CN       | U+1F1E8 + U+1F1F3 |                    |

### Record Holders and Extremes / Breaking and Gluing other characters

*   A close second place in this regard goes to the CJK unified ideographs
    [妛](https://codepoints.net/U+599B),
    [挧](https://codepoints.net/U+6327),
    [暃](https://codepoints.net/U+6683),
    [椦](https://codepoints.net/U+6926),
    [槞](https://codepoints.net/U+69DE),
    [蟐](https://codepoints.net/U+87D0),
    [袮](https://codepoints.net/U+88AE),
    [閠](https://codepoints.net/U+95A0),
    [駲](https://codepoints.net/U+99F2),
    [墸](https://codepoints.net/U+58B8),
    [壥](https://codepoints.net/U+58E5), and
    [彁](https://codepoints.net/U+5F41). These so-called [“ghost characters”](https://www.dampfkraft.com/ghost-characters.html)
    came to Unicode via the Japanese JIS standard, where they were added, because
    they were mis-read or misinterpreted from other signs, when JIS was compiled
    from original printed text sources.
