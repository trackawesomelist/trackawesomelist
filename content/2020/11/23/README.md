### Project Management / Estimations

*   [Robert "Uncle Bob" Martin talk about professionalism in software development](https://youtu.be/LmRl0D-RkPU?t=3202) - The only honest estimate is "I don't know". But you can come up with some kind of propability assessment, that will inform about the shape of the risk. This is not unlike PERT, where an activity is bounded by [optimistic, pessimistic and most-likely time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_evaluation_and_review_technique#Time). Now if managers don't take a range for an answer, don't fall in that trap. Tell them you're already trying as you possibly can. “And then the manager will have to do something very foreign: they'll have to manage. That's what management is: managing risk.”
