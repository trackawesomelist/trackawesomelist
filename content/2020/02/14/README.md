Pixabay switched to the new license [in 2019](https://pixabay.com/forum/official-pixabay-news-2/the-pixabay-license-7823/). Prior to that change, Pixabay used the [CC0 waiver](https://web.archive.org/web/20190108204845/https://pixabay.com/en/service/terms/). Therefore, old images are [still in the public domain](https://pixabay.com/it/forum/official-pixabay-news-2/the-pixabay-license-7823/?pagi=4), despite being [misleadingly tagged](https://pixabay.com/it/forum/official-pixabay-news-2/the-pixabay-license-7823/?pagi=4) with the Pixabay License.

However, old images (from [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20150328140645/http://www.spacex.com/media) to [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20191122175115/https://www.spacex.com/media)) had indeed been placed into the public domain and have no copyright restriction (including some images on [Flickr](https://web.archive.org/web/20170412063800/https://www.flickr.com/photos/spacex/16787988882/)).
