*   [Tools for better thinking](https://untools.co) - “Collection of thinking tools and frameworks to help you solve problems, make decisions and understand systems.”

### Cognitive Tools / Problem Solving

*   [First principles and asking why](https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/growth/first-principles-and-asking-why/) - “Our ability to think in abstractions can weaken our judgement, as those abstractions may no longer be as true as they once were. Also a similarly dangerous evolutionary trait is our ability to think in analogy, where we make assumptions based on the comparison of two things that are not actually related.” [Elon Musk explains it better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NV3sBlRgzTI).
*   “People who excel at software design become convinced that they have a unique ability to understand any kind of system at all, from first principles, without prior training, thanks to their superior powers of analysis. Success in the artificially constructed world of software design promotes a dangerous confidence.” - A reminder of the needs of humility and recognition of limits in our industry, [from a panel on the Moral Economy of Tech](https://idlewords.com/talks/sase_panel.htm).
*   [The Art of Powerful Questions - Catalyzing Insight, Innovation, and Action](https://umanitoba.ca/admin/human_resources/change/media/the-art-of-powerful-questions.pdf) - “Leaders believe that they are being paid for fixing problems rather than for fostering breakthrough thinking.”

*   [Strong Opinions, Weakly Held — a framework for thinking](https://medium.com/@ameet/strong-opinions-weakly-held-a-framework-for-thinking-6530d417e364) - “Allow your intuition to guide you to a conclusion, no matter how imperfect — this is the 'strong opinion' part. Then – and this is the 'weakly held' part – prove yourself wrong.”

### Cognitive Tools / Behavioral

*   [Avoiding Intellectual Phase Lock](https://books.google.com/books?id=__CnDwAAQBAJ\&lpg=PT21\&dq=intellectual%20phase%20lock%20Frank%20Dunnington\&pg=PT21#v=onepage\&q=intellectual%20phase%20lock%20Frank%20Dunnington\&f=false) - Anticipating an important result so much, humans by nature are susceptible to introduce subtle confirmation bias.
