### Cognitive Tools / Problem Solving

*   [First principles and asking why](https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/growth/first-principles-and-asking-why/) - ‚ÄúOur ability to think in abstractions can weaken our judgement, as those abstractions may no longer be as true as they once were.

*   [Strong Opinions, Weakly Held ‚Äî a framework for thinking](https://medium.com/@ameet/strong-opinions-weakly-held-a-framework-for-thinking-6530d417e364) - ‚ÄúAllow your intuition to guide you to a conclusion, no matter how imperfect ‚Äî this is the 'strong opinion' part.
