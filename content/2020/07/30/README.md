### Credit Scoring

*   [Recent developments in consumer credit risk assessment](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377221706011866) - The riskiness of lending to a credit applicant is usually estimated using a logistic regression model though researchers have considered many other types of classifier, but data quality issues may prevent these laboratory based results from being achieved in practice. The training of a classifier on a sample of accepted applicants rather than on a sample representative of the applicant population seems not to result in bias though it does result in difficulties in setting the cut off.
