(…) John always shared everything with us, even the *don't share this with your team* stuff. We were people he trusted, so it was as it should be. It made you feel like you were part of something greater.” Or why sharing some open secret promote strong trust in your entourage.

### Politics / Equity

*   [The Prince](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prince) - Machiavelli's ideas on how to accrue honor and power as a leader. Resorting to that level of politics in a company is a sure way to render the culture highly toxic, as well as corrupting and demoralizing the organization at all levels.
