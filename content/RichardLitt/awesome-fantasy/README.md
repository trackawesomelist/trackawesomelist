### Satire / [Discworld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discworld) *by [Terry Pratchett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Pratchett)*

*   [The Colour of Magic](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/601238.The_Colour_of_Magic) \[3.9]
    This is the first book of the series Discworld. The books can be read in order or independently. There are several narrative threads that cross quite often creating a funny and enjoyable reading experience.

    I love this book. The style is original and hilarious and the characters' personality is deeply developed. Death alone is a good reason to read this book. - [@fourlastor](https://github.com/fourlastor)
*   [Mort](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/386372.Mort) \[4.2]
    This was my intro to Discworld, and I loved it. Death is hilarious. - [@RichardLitt](https://github.com/RichardLitt)
*   [Making Money](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/116296.Making_Money) \[4.2]
    How Terry Pratchett consistently came up with good stories is beyond me. This one is also good, particularly for how TP envisions banks and automatons. - [@RichardLitt](https://github.com/RichardLitt)
