Sitecore is a digital platform that helps manage multiple websites from one place. It provides marketing tools that deliver information about customers from different devices (CRMs, tracking, POS, etc.). Sitecore allows creating content to be accessed via different channels (desktops, mobiles, APIs, social media, etc.). The platform is flexible by design, with numerous points of extensions, it can be deployed both on-premise and cloud. The below list classifies extensibility and deployment options for Sitecore developers they can benefit from.
