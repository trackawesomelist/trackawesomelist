### Engineering / Technical Debt

*   [The Framing of the Developer](https://www.amazingcto.com/develop-for-impact-not-for-backlog/) - Default framing is around the backlog, which leads to an asymmetry in which failure is blamed on lacks of developer performance, and success is celebrated as the full realization of the PM's vision. But “technology is the bank that gave credit”, and technical debt should be called product debt “because product took the credit to get a feature faster and must pay back by investing the time to clean up.” The alternative? “Companies today need a frame of impact. In this world-view success is defined by impact.”

Decisions should never be based on beliefs. Not in engineering. (…) As software is highly contextual we cannot predict specific problems. We can only predict classes of problems.” And that's why it is hard to estimate software projects: because developer's main activity is a long process of deducting the assumptions a system is built on.

Bullshit is characterized by giving the *surface appearance* of confidence, intelligence, or a convincing argument; whether it's actually true or not is besides the point.”

*   “It is not your job to protect people (particularly senior management) from the consequences of their decisions. Make your decisions in your own best interest; it is up to the organization to make sure that your interest aligns with theirs.” ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7179946)).
*   “If you cannot disrupt a perverted culture by introducing a new culture, the politics of the perverted culture will work against you until you break, align, or leave. It is not unwise to leave before you break and it is easier to leave before you align.” ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20914779)) - At one point, even with the most unselfish of intentions, your attempts to elevate the culture might stall.

### Agile / Delivery

*   “The fundamental problem that drives most agile failures isn't in the team's execution, it's in the business' expectations. One side is signed up for incremental delivery, and one side is set up for a fixed scope and deadline and the result is misery.” ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20326074))

### Objectives and Key Results (OKR) / Delivery

*   “One way in which I've seen OKRs used effectively is as a defense against the type of middle or upper manager who is constantly coming up with new ideas or tasks.” ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19550614)) - Or how OKRs can be weaponized to prevent top managers to mess with the (already established) schedule.

*   “When everything is great success, people behind that success shadow the people who could make success in the future. (…) Netflix is great example of how to do big transition right. Netflix was in renting DVDs by mail business.

Not the other way around. “Changes at the top — not speeches, training or hashtags — make the most cultural impact.

How to investigate what went wrong?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20786755) - “Most of the time people leave bosses, not the job or the company.” And why you're unlikely to get any substantial insights from exit interviews. ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20787874))

*   “Next time your favorite manager and tech lead quit the company, ask them why.” ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21767843)).
