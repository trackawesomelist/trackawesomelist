![Wingspan game image](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/yLZJCVLlIx4c7eJEWUNJ7w__itemrep/img/DR7181wU4sHT6gn6Q1XccpPxNHg=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\(\)/pic4458123.jpg)

### [Clank!: Catacombs](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/365717/clank-catacombs)

> The catacombs of the skeletal dragon Umbrok Vessna are mysterious and dangerous. Portals transport you all around the dungeon depths. Wayshrines offer vast riches to intrepid explorers. Prisoners are counting on you to free them. Ghosts, once disturbed, may haunt you to death. Despite all that, it's time to leave the board behind with Clank! Catacombs, a standalone deck-building adventure.
>
> Each trip into the catacombs is unique since you lay tiles to create the dungeon. You can play using only the all-new dungeon deck, or you can include cards from previous Clank! expansions.

### [Istanbul](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/148949/istanbul)

> There's hustle and bustle at Istanbul's grand bazaar as merchants and their assistants rush through the narrow alleys in their attempt to be more successful than their competitors. Everything must be well organized: wheelbarrows must be filled with goods at the warehouses, then swiftly transported by the assistants to various destinations. Your goal? Be the first merchant to collect a certain number of rubies.
>
> In Istanbul, you lead a group of one merchant and four assistants through 16 locations in the bazaar. At each such location, you can carry out a specific action. The challenge, though, is that to take an action, you must move your merchant and an assistant there, then leave the assistant behind (to handle all the details while you focus on larger matters). If you want to use that assistant again later, your merchant must return to that location to pick him up. Thus, you must plan ahead carefully to avoid being left with no assistants and thus unable to do anything...

![Istanbul game image](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/PHH9Mreen2sBcxV6ZsE3ew__itemrep/img/3-96MTKIPtgjJ8inH9DWDxCf0no=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\(\)/pic1885326.jpg)

Will the sun shine brightest on your city before the winter moon rises?
>

> Crokinole is a traditional dexterity game.

> Players take turns shooting disks across the circular wooden board by flicking the disks with their fingers. Players try to land their disks in scoring regions on the board, with the highest scoring area the recessed hole in the very center of the board. Each round, each player/side alternately shoots a set number of disks (usually 12 or 8), shooting one disk each turn.
>
> As a traditional game, there are often many variations played, but the following method is based on the National Crokinole Association's rules which also govern the World Crokinole Championship.

![Crokinole game image](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/7ejbxsn-UtLl3ehamuAEdw__itemrep/img/5OXvXz34AnlF9eCXZtNFMJ89JNc=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\(\)/pic79413.jpg)

### [Cascadia](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/295947/cascadia)

> Cascadia is a puzzly tile-laying and token-drafting game featuring the habitats and wildlife of the Pacific Northwest.
>
> In the game, you take turns building out your own terrain area and populating it with wildlife. You start with three hexagonal habitat tiles (with the five types of habitat in the game), and on a turn you choose a new habitat tile that's paired with a wildlife token, then place that tile next to your other ones and place the wildlife token on an appropriate habitat. (Each tile depicts 1-3 types of wildlife from the five types in the game, and you can place at most one tile on a habitat.) Four tiles are on display, with each tile being paired at random with a wildlife token, so you must make the best of what's available ‚Äî unless you have a nature token to spend so that you can pick your choice of each item.

![Cascadia game image](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/MjeJZfulbsM1DSV3DrGJYA__itemrep/img/RjD03wEf_LoX0EF4DhnW6f0xNHU=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\(\)/pic5100691.jpg)

### [SCOUT](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/291453/scout)

> SCOUT is a ladder-climbing game in which cards have two potential values, players may not rearrange their hand of cards, and players may pass their turn to take a card from the current high set of cards into their hand.
>
> More specifically, cards are dual-indexed, with different values on each half of the card, with the 45 cards having all possible combinations of the numbers 1-10. During set-up, whoever is shuffling the cards should randomize both the order of the cards in the deck and their orientation. Once each player has been dealt their entire hand of cards, they pick up that hand without rearranging any of the cards; if they wish, they can rotate their entire hand of cards in order to use the values on the other end of each card, but again they cannot rearrange the order of cards in their hand.

### [Azul](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/230802/azul)

> Introduced by the Moors, azulejos (originally white and blue ceramic tiles) were fully embraced by the Portuguese when their king Manuel I, on a visit to the Alhambra palace in Southern Spain, was mesmerized by the stunning beauty of the Moorish decorative tiles. The king, awestruck by the interior beauty of the Alhambra, immediately ordered that his own palace in Portugal be decorated with similar wall tiles. As a tile-laying artist, you have been challenged to embellish the walls of the Royal Palace of Evora.
>
> In the game Azul, players take turns drafting colored tiles from suppliers to their player board. Later in the round, players score points based on how they've placed their tiles to decorate the palace. Extra points are scored for specific patterns and completing sets; wasted supplies harm the player's score. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.

### [Azul: Summer Pavilion](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/287954/azul-summer-pavilion)

> At the turn of the 16th Century, King Manuel I commissioned Portugal's greatest artisans to construct grandiose buildings. After completing the Palaces of Evora and Sintra, the king sought to build a summer pavilion to honor the most famous members of the royal family. This construction was intended for the most talented artisans ‚Äî whose skills meet the splendor that the royal family deserves. Sadly, King Manuel I died before construction ever began.
>
> In Azul: Summer Pavilion, players return to Portugal to accomplish the task that never began. As a master artisan, you must use the finest materials to create the summer pavilion while carefully avoiding wasting supplies. Only the best will rise to the challenge to honor the Portuguese royal family.

### [Patchwork](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/163412/patchwork)

> In Patchwork, two players compete to build the most aesthetic (and high-scoring) patchwork quilt on a personal 9x9 game board. To start play, lay out all of the patches at random in a circle and place a marker directly clockwise of the 2-1 patch. Each player takes five buttons ‚Äî the currency/points in the game ‚Äî and someone is chosen as the start player.
>
> On a turn, a player either purchases one of the three patches standing clockwise of the spool or passes. To purchase a patch, you pay the cost in buttons shown on the patch, move the spool to that patch's location in the circle, add the patch to your game board, then advance your time token on the time track a number of spaces equal to the time shown on the patch. You're free to place the patch anywhere on your board that doesn't overlap other patches, but you probably want to fit things together as tightly as possible. If your time token is behind or on top of the other player's time token, then you take another turn; otherwise the opponent now goes. Instead of purchasing a patch, you can choose to pass; to do this, you move your time token to the space immediately in front of the opponent's time token, then take one button from the bank for each space you moved.

> Queen Gimnax has ordered the reclamation of the northern lands. As a cartographer in her service, you are sent to map this territory, claiming it for the Kingdom of Nalos. Through official edicts, the queen announces which lands she prizes most, and you will increase your reputation by meeting her demands. But you are not alone in this wilderness. The Dragul contest your claims with their outposts, so you must draw your lines carefully to reduce their influence. Reclaim the greatest share of the queen‚Äôs desired lands and you will be declared the greatest cartographer in the kingdom.
>
> In Cartographers: A Roll Player Tale, players compete to earn the most reputation stars by the time four seasons have passed. Each season, players draw on their map sheets and earn reputation by carrying out the queen's edicts before the season is over. The player with the most reputation stars at the end of winter wins!

### Strategy

### [Blood Rage](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/170216/blood-rage)

> "Life is Battle; Battle is Glory; Glory is ALL"
> In Blood Rage, each player controls their own Viking clan‚Äôs warriors, leader, and ship. Ragnar√∂k has come, and it‚Äôs the end of the world! It‚Äôs the Vikings‚Äô last chance to go down in a blaze of glory and secure their place in Valhalla at Odin‚Äôs side! For a Viking there are many pathways to glory. You can invade and pillage the land for its rewards, crush your opponents in epic battles, fulfill quests, increase your clan's stats, or even die gloriously either in battle or from Ragnar√∂k, the ultimate inescapable doom.
> Most player strategies are guided by the cards drafted at the beginning of each of the three game rounds (or Ages). These ‚ÄúGods‚Äô Gifts‚Äù grant you numerous boons for your clan including: increased Viking strength and devious battle strategies, upgrades to your clan, or even the aid of legendary creatures from Norse mythology. They may also include various quests, from dominating specific provinces, to having lots of your Vikings sent to Valhalla. Most of these cards are aligned with one of the Norse gods, hinting at the kind of strategy they support. For example, Thor gives more glory for victory in battle, Heimdall grants you foresight and surprises, Tyr strengthens you in battle, while the trickster Loki actually rewards you for losing battles, or punishes the winner.

> In Puerto Rico, players assume the roles of colonial governors on the island of Puerto Rico. The aim of the game is to amass victory points by shipping goods to Europe or by constructing buildings.
> Each player uses a separate small board with spaces for city buildings, plantations, and resources. Shared between the players are three ships, a trading house, and a supply of resources and doubloons.
> The resource cycle of the game is that players grow crops which they exchange for points or doubloons. Doubloons can then be used to buy buildings, which allow players to produce more crops or give them other abilities. Buildings and plantations do not work unless they are manned by colonists.

> In the dystopic 1930s, the industrial revolution pushed the exploitation of fossil-based resources to the limit, and now the only thing powerful enough to quench the thirst for power of the massive machines and of the unstoppable engineering progress is the unlimited hydroelectric energy provided by the rivers.
> Barrage is a resource management strategic game in which players compete to build their majestic dams, raise them to increase their storing capacity, and deliver all the potential power through pressure tunnels connected to the energy turbines of their powerhouses.

### [Too Many Bones](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/192135/too-many-bones)

> Too Many Bones comes loaded for bear by breaking into a new genre: the dice-builder RPG. This game takes everything you think you know about dice-rolling and turns it on its head. Dripping with strategy, this fantasy-based RPG puts you in the skin of a new race and takes you on an adventure to the northern territories to root out and defeat growing enemy forces and of course the infamous "baddie" responsible.
> Team up or go it alone in a 1-4 player Coop or Solo play campaign. With over 100+ unique skill dice and 4-7 classes to choose from, every battle is its own mini challenge to figure out. Your adventure will consist of 8-12 battles before you reach your final destination and face off against one of a number of possible kingpins in order to win. Along the way, you will be faced with storyline decisions that will quickly have you weighing risk/reward, odds, and logic - with dice woven into every aspect! Your party will also be faced with other decisions: when to rest, when to explore, or even which fights to pursue! The Encounter cards offer fun plot twists and some comic relief, all while setting the stage for your next battle.

### [Pandemic Legacy: Season 0](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/314040/pandemic-legacy-season-0)

> 1962 ‚Äî The Cold War continues as a new threat looms on the horizon, a deadly new Soviet bioweapon, something called "Project MEDUSA". You and your fellow medical graduates have been recruited by the CIA for the critical mission of investigating and preventing its development. Travel the world using carefully constructed aliases to move swiftly between Allied, Neutral, and Soviet cities. Your missions will require you to neutralize enemy agents, acquire specific targets, and set up other CIA agents on location to execute your operations without a hitch. As you complete objectives over the course of twelve months, each success or failure will bring you closer to the truth.
> Combatting this dangerous new pathogen is of utmost importance, but it's not the only threat you'll encounter in the field. Enemy agents are taking root in all parts of the world, and it's critical to your mission that you keep them contained before they can escalate international tensions. Luckily for you, you won't be without backup. Coordinate with other covert operatives for assistance and make strategic use of these teams at different locations to clean up the board and keep your eye on your main objectives.

### [Agricola](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/31260/agricola)

> Description from BoardgameNews
> In Agricola, you're a farmer in a wooden shack with your spouse and little else. On a turn, you get to take only two actions, one for you and one for the spouse, from all the possibilities you'll find on a farm: collecting clay, wood, or stone; building fences; and so on. You might think about having kids in order to get more work accomplished, but first you need to expand your house. And what are you going to feed all the little rugrats?
> The game supports many levels of complexity, mainly through the use (or non-use) of two of its main types of cards, Minor Improvements and Occupations. In the beginner's version (called the Family Variant in the U.S. release), these cards are not used at all. For advanced play, the U.S. release includes three levels of both types of cards; Basic (E-deck), Interactive (I-deck), and Complex (K-deck), and the rulebook encourages players to experiment with the various decks and mixtures thereof. Aftermarket decks such as the Z-Deck and the L-Deck also exist.

> Gaia Project is a captivating board game, a spiritual successor to Terra Mystica. In this game, players take on the roles of fourteen distinct factions, each native to one of seven unique types of planets. To thrive and expand, these factions must terraform neighboring planets into their own habitats, all while competing with other groups for resources and space. Gaia planets serve as common grounds for colonization, and Transdimensional planets can be transformed into Gaia planets, creating additional layers of strategic complexity. All factions can enhance their skills across six key areas of development: Terraforming, Navigation, Artificial Intelligence, Gaiaforming, Economy, and Research, leading to advanced technology and unique bonuses. Each faction boasts its own set of skills and abilities, adding depth to the gameplay. The game board consists of ten sectors, offering a variable setup for enhanced replayability, making Gaia Project an engaging and strategic experience for players looking to explore the frontiers of interstellar colonization.

### [Pax Pamir: Second Edition](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/256960/pax-pamir-second-edition)

> In Pax Pamir, players assume the role of nineteenth century Afghan leaders attempting to forge a new state after the collapse of the Durrani Empire. Western histories often call this period "The Great Game" because of the role played by the Europeans who attempted to use central Asia as a theater for their own rivalries. In this game, those empires are viewed strictly from the perspective of the Afghans who sought to manipulate the interloping ferengi (foreigners) for their own purposes.
> In terms of game play, Pax Pamir is a pretty straightforward tableau builder. Players spend most of their turns purchasing cards from a central market, then playing those cards in front of them in a single row called a court. Playing cards adds units to the game's map and grants access to additional actions that can be taken to disrupt other players and influence the course of the game. That last point is worth emphasizing. Though everyone is building their own row of cards, the game offers many ways for players to interfere with each other directly and indirectly.

Players engage in a dance of influence, intelligence, and diplomatic maneuvering, representing the two superpowers' efforts to shape the world according to their ideologies. Based on the renowned card-driven game tradition, Twilight Struggle presents a low-complexity, quick-playing experience in which players use cards and units strategically on a world map to gain allies and control key regions.

> Electric vehicles (EVs) have become more common since 2014 and are the future of the automobile industry. They are superior vehicles due to them being more efficient, easier to maintain, cleaner, and cheaper to run. They are computerized machines that use AI to improve safety and in the near future will provide autonomous driving. They receive software upgrades during their lifetime and are constantly improving, unlike their traditional combustion-engine counterparts, which start to become obsolete as soon as you start using them.
> You will be overseeing the production of these vehicles in Kanban EV, with "kanban" (ÁúãÊùø) being the name for a scheduling system that supports an efficient assembly line, just-in-time production, and a smooth workflow process.

### [Brass: Lancashire](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/28720/brass-lancashire)

> Brass: Lancashire, formerly known as Brass, is an engaging economic strategy game that immerses players in the competitive world of cotton entrepreneurs during the industrial revolution in Lancashire. The objective is to develop, construct, and expand your industrial network to meet the high demand for iron, coal, and cotton. The game unfolds in two phases, the canal phase, and the rail phase, with victory points (VPs) being the ultimate goal. Players take turns, with each round offering two actions to choose from a set list, which includes building industries, constructing canals or rails, developing industries, selling cotton, or taking a loan. The turn order depends on the amount of money spent, creating strategic opportunities for those who go later in the order. After the canal phase, a scoring round occurs, followed by the rail phase with expanded building possibilities. After another scoring round, the game concludes, and the winner is determined. The game's unique card system dictates where industries can be built while allowing flexible use for other actions, encouraging strategic card management. Resources are shared, adding depth to competition, as players often rely on each other's production. This 2018 edition by Roxley Games features new artwork and rules enhancements, making it a captivating and improved experience for players aiming to build the most prosperous industrial empire in Lancashire.

### [Underwater Cities](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/247763/underwater-cities)

> In Underwater Cities, which takes about 30-45 minutes per player, players represent the most powerful brains in the world, brains nominated due to the overpopulation of Earth to establish the best and most livable underwater areas possible.
> The main principle of the game is card placement. Three colored cards are placed along the edge of the main board into 3 x 5 slots, which are also colored. Ideally players can place cards into slots of the same color. Then they can take both actions and advantages: the action depicted in the slot on the main board and also the advantage of the card. Actions and advantages can allow players to intake raw materials; to build and upgrade city domes, tunnels and production buildings such as farms, desalination devices and laboratories in their personal underwater area; to move their marker on the initiative track (which is important for player order in the next turn); to activate the player's "A-cards"; and to collect cards, both special ones and basic ones that allow for better decision possibilities during gameplay.

### [Agon | Queen Guard | Royal Guard](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/5168/queens-guard)

> Queen's Guard, also known as Agon, is a strategic board game played on a hexagonal board consisting of 91 smaller hexagons, with a central hexagon known as the throne. The board features alternating colors of hexagons in rings, radiating from the throne. Each player has one queen piece and six guard pieces, which start in alternating positions along the outer ring of the board. Players take turns moving their pieces towards the center of the board, either forward or laterally. A player's piece can be captured by an opponent if it is surrounded on two sides in a straight line, and the captured piece must then be relocated to the outer ring. To win the game, a player must successfully maneuver their queen onto the throne while also surrounding it with all six of their guard pieces. Queen's Guard is a strategic game that requires careful planning and tactical thinking to achieve victory.

### [Ambush!](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1608/ambush)

> Ambush! is a strategy board game developed by Avalon Hill, known for its innovative approach to single-player gameplay in the wargaming genre. Released in 1983, it broke away from the traditional requirement of two players by allowing a solo player to engage in man-to-man combat scenarios. What made Ambush! unique was its use of tables, charts, and a "paragraph book" to control the opponent's actions, eliminating the need for an opposing player. This approach kept the enemy hidden until they became visible through gameplay, enhancing the element of surprise and realism. While it allowed for multiple players to participate by controlling different squads or soldiers, the complexity of scenario creation often required players to purchase expansion modules. Ambush! is a strategy game that offers an engaging and challenging experience for players seeking tactical warfare simulations.

> The nefarious Marquise de Cat has seized the great woodland, intent on harvesting its riches. Under her rule, the many creatures of the forest have banded together. This Alliance will seek to strengthen its resources and subvert the rule of Cats. In this effort, the Alliance may enlist the help of the wandering Vagabonds who are able to move through the more dangerous woodland paths. Though some may sympathize with the Alliance‚Äôs hopes and dreams, these wanderers are old enough to remember the great birds of prey who once controlled the woods.

### [Viticulture Essential Edition](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/183394/viticulture-essential-edition)

> In Viticulture, the players find themselves in the roles of people in rustic, pre-modern Tuscany who have inherited meager vineyards. They have a few plots of land, an old crushpad, a tiny cellar, and three workers. They each have a dream of being the first to call their winery a true success.
> The players are in the position of determining how they want to allocate their workers throughout the year. Every season is different on a vineyard, so the workers have different tasks they can take care of in the summer and winter. There's competition over those tasks, and often the first worker to get to the job has an advantage over subsequent workers.
> Fortunately for the vineyard owners, people love to visit wineries, and it just so happens that many of those visitors are willing to help out around the vineyard when they visit as long as you assign a worker to take care of them. Their visits (in the form of cards) are brief but can be very helpful.

> On November 1, 1755, Lisbon suffered an earthquake of an estimated magnitude of 8.5‚Äì9.0, followed by a tsunami and three days of fires. The city was almost totally destroyed. The Marques of Pombal ‚Äî Sebasti√£o Jos√© de Carvalho e Melo ‚Äî was the then Minister of Foreign Affairs and the King put him in charge of the reconstruction of Lisbon. The Marques of Pombal gathered a team of engineers and architects and you, the players, are members of the nobility; members who will use your influence in the reconstruction and business development of the new city. You will work with the architects to build Lisbon anew, with the Marquis to develop commerce and with the King to open all the buildings, but the true reason you do all this is not for greatness or fame or even fortune, but for the most important thing of all in that time: wigs.

Invent your own zany two-word products ‚Äì Rumor Mirror! Burp Balloon! ‚Äì and sell them to all types of wacky customers. If the round's customer buys your product, you win the round! To set up Snake Oil, each player takes six purple word cards. The customer for the round draws a customer card and announces it. Inventors quickly combine two purple word cards from their hand to form a crazy new product to sell to that customer. When ready, each inventor quickly pitches his or her product directly to the customer. The customer can end any pitch that goes longer than thirty seconds. The customer decides which product to buy and gives the inventor of that product the round's customer card as the prize. Inventors discard all used word cards and take two new word cards each. The player to the left of the customer becomes the next round's customer. Play repeats until each player has been the customer once. Whoever collects the most customer cards wins the game.

> Bagh Chal (tiger game) is a strategic, two-player board game that originated in Nepal. The game is asymmetric in that one player controls four tigers and the other player controls up to twenty goats. The tigers hunt the goats while the goats attempt to block the tiger's movements.

Gameplay takes place in two phases. In the first phase the goats are placed on the board while the tigers are moved. In the second phase both the tigers and the goats are moved. For the tigers the goal is to capture five goats to win. A goat can be captured by jumping over it, although capturing is not obligatory. The goats win by blocking all of tiger's leagal moves.

### [Animocrazy](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/542/animocrazy)

> How can the Jolly Pets resist the big bag of candies right in front of them? Everything goes well at the beginning when they calmly agree on the same amount of candies for each of them, but soon they come up with more and more ideas and a debate starts‚Ä¶ the Pig says,‚ÄúThose who weigh over 10kg should get an extra candy!‚Äù... the Dog says, ‚ÄúWhoever oversleeps should return a candy to the pool!‚Äù To resolve their hectic argument, they finally decide to form the House of Pets, at which the animal councilors will discuss proposals and vote on new laws. Who can get the most delicious candies in this exciting voting game? Based on Karl-Heinz Schmiel's Das Regeln Wir Schon, players attempt to pass laws which benefit themselves. The laws are either immediate or semi-permanent, and they can have all kinds of different effects: all players with beards get five points, vote cards must be played with the left hand, or some sort of re-evaluation or redistribution of the chips that each player has. The chips are the main way that players score, but their worth fluctuates constantly. On a turn, a player draws a card and then proposes a vote, and this continues until the End card is drawn.

The bidding continues until one player is ready to "out-geek" their friends. Collect a predetermined number of cards, and you win!

> In the game, which was first published as Die Gr√∂√üe macht's! in German, players start with a stack of question cards, with each card having three questions and the game having 200 cards. On a turn, the active player reads one question to the other players, who then collectively decide on a numerical answer for that question. The reader must then state whether the answer given is too high, too low, or exactly right. If the reader guesses wrong, he removes the card from the game and the next player chooses the next question; if he guessed "over" or "under" and was right, he keeps the card, then passes the deck; if he guessed "exactly right" and was right, he keeps the card, then reads the next question himself. Bonus! When the stack of cards runs out, the game ends and whoever has the most cards wins.
