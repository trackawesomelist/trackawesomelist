Even when Blazor was brand new, we used it in our latest project, which really helped us. Seeing other people in our field, I can say that Blazor was a key to our project's success. Our journey with Blazor has mostly been easy, but we have still learned a lot along the way. In this video, I will share some tips and lessons we have picked up. I will also discuss how to make smart choices and avoid problems when you're changing your existing project to use Blazor.

Everyone in our team is a C# developer, so when we went into our latest project Blazor was a natural choice, even though Blazor was only a week old. Looking at my peers working in the same space, I am convinced that it saved our project by switching to Blazor. Even though it has been mostly smooth sailing we have learned a lot during the years. In this session, Jimmy Engström will give you some of the tips, tricks, and learnings we have collected over the years, when to choose what, and how to avoid pitfalls converting your exiting project to Blazor.

## [2. Awesome Azure Openai Llm](/content/kimtth/awesome-azure-openai-llm/README.md)

### **Build an LLMs from scratch: picoGPT and lit-gpt** / **GPT series release date**

*   An unnecessarily tiny implementation of GPT-2 in NumPy. [picoGPT (⭐3.1k)](https://github.com/jaymody/picoGPT): Transformer Decoder \[Jan 2023]

    ```python
    q = x @ w_k # [n_seq, n_embd] @ [n_embd, n_embd] -> [n_seq, n_embd]
    k = x @ w_q # [n_seq, n_embd] @ [n_embd, n_embd] -> [n_seq, n_embd]
    v = x @ w_v # [n_seq, n_embd] @ [n_embd, n_embd] -> [n_seq, n_embd]

    # In picoGPT, combine w_q, w_k and w_v into a single matrix w_fc
    x = x @ w_fc # [n_seq, n_embd] @ [n_embd, 3*n_embd] -> [n_seq, 3*n_embd]
    ```
