## [1. Awesome Neovim](/content/rockerBOO/awesome-neovim/README.md)

### Colorscheme Creation / Diagnostics

*   [roobert/palette.nvim (⭐63)](https://github.com/roobert/palette.nvim) - A beautiful, versatile, systematic, theme system.

### Git / Diagnostics

*   [niuiic/git-log.nvim (⭐15)](https://github.com/niuiic/git-log.nvim) - Check git log of the selected code.

## [2. Awesome Billing](/content/kdeldycke/awesome-billing/README.md)

### Pricing / Usage-based Pricing

*   [Octane's Meter Types](https://docs.getoctane.io/data-types-reporting-types-and-aggregations#Wggma) - Nice illustrations of the quantization applied to time and value quantums on variable usages.

### Cost Forecast / Market Research

*   [Darts (⭐7.3k)](https://github.com/unit8co/darts) - Python library for user-friendly forecasting and anomaly detection on time series. It wraps a huge number of models, including [Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/). Great for experiments, but bear in mind that all the [models in Darts expects](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37665435) that your data comes at a very regular interval, and make a lot of assumptions about their shape.
