> In this competitive board game, 2-5 players embark on quests, make moral choices, fight monsters, and sometimes brawl with other witchers to defend their school's honor. Players construct unique decks with attacks, dodges, and witcher magic called "signs" to achieve powerful combos. Earn money, obtain items, and train skills through quests, battles or even dice poker.
