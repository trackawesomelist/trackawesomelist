## [16. Awesome Board Games](/content/edm00se/awesome-board-games/README.md)

### Strategy

### [Caylus](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/18602/caylus)

> The players embody master builders. By building the King's castle and developing the city around it, they earn prestige points and gain the King's favor. When the castle is finished, the player who has earned the most prestige wins the game. The expansion Caylus Expansion: The Jeweller was included in the 2nd Edition.

> Each turn, players pay to place their workers in various buildings in the village. These buildings allow players to gather resources or money, or to build or upgrade buildings with those resources. Players can also use their resources to help build the castle itself, earning points and favors from the king, which provide larger bonuses. Building a building provides some immediate points, and potentially income throughout the game, since players receive bonuses when others use their buildings. The buildings chosen by the players have a heavy impact on the course of the game, since they determine the actions that will be available to all the players.

### Party

### [Arkham Horror](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/15987/arkham-horror)

> The year is 1926, and it is the height of the Roaring Twenties. Flappers dance till dawn in smoke-filled speakeasies drinking alcohol supplied by rum runners and the mob. It's a celebration to end all celebrations in the aftermath of the war to end all wars.Yet a dark shadow grows in the city of Arkham. Alien entities known as Ancient Ones lurk in the emptiness beyond space and time, writhing at the gates between worlds. These gates have begun to open and must be closed before the Ancient Ones make our world their ruined domination.

### [Zombie Kidz Evolution](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/256952/zombie-kidz-evolution)

> Zombie Kidz Evolution is the first "legacy"-style game for kids, with basic gameplay similar to the 2013 title Zombie Kidz ‚Äî but things will quickly evolve!.In the game, the young players are at school when zombies start to attack, infiltrating the entryways, then barring the way to classrooms. Players move through rooms and entryways to eliminate zombies and keep the zombie reserve full. If a zombie must enter the school but none are available, then the school has been overrun and the players lose. To win the game, players need to lock each of the four entryways as apparently the custodian has abandoned the post and given up the school for lost. As players get better, they can complete missions, track their development through a trophy-sticker system reminiscent of video games, and open envelopes that contain new material for the game, upping the challenge they face while also providing them with new powers and new heroes as well.

### [Diplomacy](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/483/diplomacy)

> This classic game of pure negotiation has taken many forms over the years. The first The Avalon Hill Game Co version has perhaps the widest release, but Avalon Hill re-released the game in 1999, complete with a colorful new map and metal pieces. In 2008, Avalon Hill released a 50th anniversary edition with a new map and cardboard pieces representing the armies and navies.In the game, players represent one of the seven "Great Powers of Europe" (Great Britain, France, Austria-Hungary, Germany, Italy, Russia or Turkey) in the years prior to World War I. Play begins in the Spring of 1901, and players make both Spring and Autumn moves each year. There are only two kinds of military units: armies and fleets. On any given turn, each of your military units has limited options: they can move into an adjoining territory, support an allied unit in an attack on an adjoining territory, support an allied unit in defending an adjoining territory, or hold their position. Players instruct each of their units by writing a set of "orders." The outcome of each turn is determined by the rules of the game. There are no dice rolls or other elements of chance. With its incredibly simplistic movement mechanics fused to a significant negotiation element, this system is highly respected by many gamers.

### [Amerigo](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/137408/amerigo)

> In Amerigo, the players help Amerigo Vespucci on his journey to discover new land. The players explore the islands of South America, secure trading routes, and build settlements.The actions available to players are determined through the use of a specialized cube tower, which has appeared in the Queen titles Im Zeichen des Kreuzes and Wallenstein. At the start of the game, this tower is seeded with action cubes, which come in seven colors, with each color matching a particular type of action. During the game players will drop additional action cubes into the tower ‚Äì but some of these cubes might get stuck in the floors of the tower while other cubes already in the tower are knocked free. Thus, players need to play both tactically ‚Äì taking advantage of the actions currently available in the best way possible ‚Äì and strategically ‚Äì using their knowledge of which actions do what to play well over the course of the game.The game board is composed of nine, twelve or sixteen tiles, depending on the number of players. Players sail their ships through the landscape created for this game, landing on islands to plan and build settlements, which then supply resources and allow the player to earn victory points. Players might want to invest in cannons to protect themselves from pirates roaming the waters or acquire progress tokens to gain special advantages.

### [Dominion](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/36218/dominion)

> Dominion is a strategic deck-building board game that transports players to the medieval era, where they wield the power to shape their own dominion. With an ever-expanding array of kingdom cards representing economic, military, and political facets, players craft their decks to conquer provinces and accumulate victory points. The game's modular design ensures endless strategic permutations, challenging players to navigate the delicate balance between growth and defense. In the end, Dominion is not just a game of cards; it's a dynamic journey through the complexities of empire-building, where each decision influences the rise or fall of your dominion.

> Falling Koalas is a card game all about koalas. Drop Bears, as they are affectionately called, are known to eat eucalyptus leaves and sleep all day. Although seemingly cute and cuddly, they attack!
> The game involves intense strategy and a bit of luck where players battle to see who will be the last koala hanging. It's easy to learn and takes 10-20 minutes to play.
> The game is simple. Be the last koala alive and win the game
> Play cards from your hand and end your turn by drawing a card. If you draw a falling koala card, you fall and are out of the game unless you can save yourself.
