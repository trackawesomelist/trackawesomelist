### [Loter√≠a](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/5878/loteria)

> Loter√≠a (Spanish word meaning "lottery") is a traditional game of chance, similar to bingo, but using images on a deck of cards instead of numbered ping pong balls. Every image has a name and an assigned number, but the number is usually ignored. Each player has at least one tabla, a board with a randomly created 4 x 4 grid of pictures with their corresponding name and number. Players choose a tabla (Spanish word for "board") to play with, from a variety of previously created tablas, each with a different selection of images.

### [Outfoxed](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/172931/outfoxed)

> This game is like Clue but for younger kids ‚Äì and yet still fun for adults too. A fox stole a pot pie, and you have to figure out which fox it was before they escape into the foxhole. My kids regularly play this cooperative whodunnit game independently, and I love watching them work together as a team to solve the mystery. This is a fun little game to build your child‚Äôs logic and deductive reasoning skills!
