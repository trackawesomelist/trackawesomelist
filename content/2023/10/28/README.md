## [2. Awesome Agi Cocosci](/content/YuzheSHI/awesome-agi-cocosci/README.md)

### Science Logology / AI Assisted Research

*   [Human‚Äìmachine collaboration for improving semiconductor process development](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05773-7) - ***Nature***, 2023. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=10295771969614897767)]. \[[Nature News](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01353-x)]. This work studies Bayesian optimization algorithms to investigate how artificial intelligence (AI) might decrease the cost of developing complex semiconductor chip processes. In particular, this work create a controlled virtual process game to systematically benchmark the performance of humans and computers for the design of a semiconductor fabrication process. The authors find that human engineers excel in the early stages of development, whereas the algorithms are far more cost-efficient near the tight tolerances of the target.
