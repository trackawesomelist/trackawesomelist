## [5. Awesome Agi Cocosci](/content/YuzheSHI/awesome-agi-cocosci/README.md)

### Complexity & Information Theory / Theory

*   [On the Complexity of Bayesian Generalization](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/shi23i.html) - ***ICML'23***, 2023. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5817813824878811147)]. \[[Project (‚≠ê8)](https://github.com/SHI-Yu-Zhe/bayesian-generalization-complexity)]. \[[Models](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eCuFqBYN8kuiAmoVtXWedXW0r0TdY55W/view)]. This work examine concept generalization at a large scale in the natural visual spectrum. Established computational modes (i.e., rule-based or similarity-based) are primarily studied isolated, focusing on confined and abstract problem spaces. This work studies these two modes when the problem space scales up and when the complexity of concepts becomes diverse. At the representational level, the authors investigate how the complexity varies when a visual concept is mapped to the representation space. Prior literature has shown that two types of complexities build an inverted-U relation. Leveraging Representativeness of Attribute (RoA), the authors computationally confirm: Models use attributes with high RoA to describe visual concepts, and the description length falls in an inverted-U relation with the increment in visual complexity. At the computational level, the authors examine how the complexity of representation affects the shift between the rule- and similarity-based generalization. The authors hypothesize that category-conditioned visual modeling estimates the co-occurrence frequency between visual and categorical attributes, thus potentially serving as the prior for the natural visual world. Experimental results show that representations with relatively high subjective complexity outperform those with relatively low subjective complexity in rule-based generalization, while the trend is the opposite in similarity-based generalization.

### Science Logology / Science Education

*   [PersLEARN: Research Training through the Lens of Perspective Cultivation](https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-demo.2/) - ***ACL'23***, 2023. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=6242389165210232890)]. Scientific research is inherently shaped by its authors‚Äô perspectives, influenced by various factors such as their personality, community, or society. Junior researchers often face challenges in identifying the perspectives reflected in the existing literature and struggle to develop their own viewpoints. To address the problem, this paper introduces PersLEARN, a tool designed to facilitate the cultivation of scientific perspectives, starting from a basic seed idea and progressing to a well-articulated framework.

### Science Logology / AI Assisted Research

*   [A foundation model for generalizable disease detection from retinal images](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06555-x) - ***Nature***, 2023. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3139988207343394501)].

### Strategy

### [Concordia Venus](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/256916/concordia-venus)

> Concordia Venus is a standalone reimplementation of Concordia with some added features.
> Concordia Venus is a peaceful strategy game of economic development in Roman times for 2-6 players aged 13 and up. Instead of looking to the luck of dice or cards, players must rely on their strategic abilities. Be sure to watch your rivals to determine which goals they are pursuing and where you can outpace them! In the game, colonists are sent out from Rome to settle down in cities that produce bricks, food, tools, wine, and cloth. Each player starts with an identical set of playing cards and acquires more cards during the game. These cards serve two purposes:
> They allow a player to choose actions during the game.
> They are worth victory points (VPs) at the end of the game.

> Mechs vs. Minions is a cooperative tabletop campaign for 2-4 players. Set in the world of Runeterra, players take on the roles of four intrepid Yordles: Corki, Tristana, Heimerdinger, and Ziggs, who must join forces and pilot their newly-crafted mechs against an army of marauding minions.

### [Le Havre](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/35677/le-havre)

> In Le Havre, a player's turn consists of two parts: First, distribute newly supplied goods onto the offer spaces; then take an action. As an action, players may choose either to take all goods of one type from an offer space or to use one of the available buildings. Building actions allow players to upgrade goods, sell them or use them to build their own buildings and ships. Buildings are both an investment opportunity and a revenue stream, as players must pay an entry fee to use buildings that they do not own. Ships, on the other hand, are primarily used to provide the food that is needed to feed the workers.
> After every seven turns, the round ends: players' cattle and grain may multiply through a Harvest, and players must feed their workers. After a fixed number of rounds, each player may carry out one final action, and then the game ends. Players add the value of their buildings and ships to their cash reserves. The player who has amassed the largest fortune is the winner.

### [Grand Austria Hotel](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/182874/grand-austria-hotel)

> In the thick of the Viennese modern age, exquisite caf√©s are competing for customers. Inspiring artists, important politicians, and tourists from all over the world are populating Vienna and in need of a hotel room. This is your opportunity to turn your little caf√© into a world famous hotel. Hire staff, fulfill the wishes of your guests, and gain the emperor's favor. Only then will your caf√© become the Grand Austria Hotel.
> The start player rolls the dice, sorting them by the rolled number and placing them on the corresponding action spaces. On a turn, a player chooses one of the six actions and carries it out. The number of the available dice in the corresponding action spaces determines how much the player gets from the action. They then remove one of the dice and can carry out additional actions. With the different actions, a player can get the necessary drinks and dishes, prepare the rooms, or hire staff.
