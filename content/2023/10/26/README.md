### Strategy

### [Checkers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checkers)

> Checkers, also known as American Draughts, an abstract strategy game where players move disc-shaped pieces across an 8 by 8 cross-hatched ("checker") board. Pieces only move diagonally, and only one space at a time. If a player can move one of his pieces so that it jumps over an adjacent piece of their opponent and into an empty space, that player captures the opponent's disc.

### [Star Wars: The Deckbuilding Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Deckbuilding_Game)

> Star Wars is a deckbuilding game released by Fantasy Flight Games and Asmodee.Each player controls a base that represent that player's life pool, and is able to obtain another base if theirs is destroyed. The object is to destroy three bases to win the game, which is achieved by attacking the opposing player.On their turn, a player uses the resources from the five cards in their hand to obtain new cards from a central "galaxy row", which contains cards of the Empire and Rebel factions. The player may only select from cards of their faction, and the galaxy row is reconstituted with cards from the "galaxy deck".One innovate game mechanic is the ability of a player to attack cards still in the galaxy row before they have been obtained by other players, known as sabotage for the Rebel faction and bounty hunting for the Empire faction. These provide a reward to the player taking that action, and also deny other players from obtaining targeted cards.Throughout the game, a Force meter records the balance in The Force, which may alter the effect of cards in favour of a particular faction.

Players make successively higher declarations regarding the results of all the dice remaining in the game, e.g. "there are ten sixes". However, someone can always contest the bid. When that happens, all the dice are revealed and either the bidder or the caller loses dice, depending on who was correct. The last player with dice is the winner.

Players begin with a home tile and eight workers, each in red, yellow, or blue, which are used for bidding on tiles and for resource generation and skill acquisition. During spring, summer, and autumn, additional workers with skills related to key resources like iron, stone, and wood arrive, and random village tiles are auctioned. In the winter, no new workers arrive, and players select village tiles for auction, which offer victory points based on combinations of resources, skills, and workers. The player with the most victory points at the end of the winter season wins the game.
