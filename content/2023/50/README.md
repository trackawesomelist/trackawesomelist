### **What is the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)?**

*   In a 2020 paper, Meta (Facebook) came up with a framework called retrieval-augmented generation to give LLMs access to information beyond their training data. [Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401): \[[cnt](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en\&as_sdt=0%2C5\&q=arxiv%3A+2005.11401)] \[22 May 2020]

    1.  RAG-sequence — We retrieve k documents, and use them to generate all the output tokens that answer a user query.
    2.  RAG-token— We retrieve k documents, use them to generate the next token, then retrieve k more documents, use them to generate the next token, and so on. This means that we could end up retrieving several different sets of documents in the generation of a single answer to a user’s query.
    3.  Of the two approaches proposed in the paper, the RAG-sequence implementation is pretty much always used in the industry. It’s cheaper and simpler to run than the alternative, and it produces great results.

*   GPT-4 details leaked
    *   GPT-4 is a language model with approximately 1.8 trillion parameters across 120 layers, 10x larger than GPT-3. It uses a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model with 16 experts, each having about 111 billion parameters. Utilizing MoE allows for more efficient use of resources during inference, needing only about 280 billion parameters and 560 TFLOPs, compared to the 1.8 trillion parameters and 3,700 TFLOPs required for a purely dense model.
    *   The model is trained on approximately 13 trillion tokens from various sources, including internet data, books, and research papers. To reduce training costs, OpenAI employs tensor and pipeline parallelism, and a large batch size of 60 million. The estimated training cost for GPT-4 is around $63 million.

This is achieved by training the model on all downstream academic benchmarks. It appears to be a subtle criticism underlining how easily benchmarks can be "cheated" intentionally or unintentionally (due to data contamination). [cite](https://twitter.com/rasbt) \[13 Sep 2023]
