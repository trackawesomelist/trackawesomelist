    *   `Q-Former (Querying Transformer)`: A transformer model that consists of two submodules that share the same self-attention layers: an image transformer that interacts with a frozen image encoder for visual feature extraction, and a text transformer that can function as both a text encoder and a text decoder.
    *   Q-Former is a lightweight transformer which employs a set of learnable query vectors to extract visual features from the frozen image encoder. It acts as an information bottleneck between the frozen image encoder and the frozen LLM.
