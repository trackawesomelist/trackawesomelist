## [1. Awesome Agi Cocosci](/content/YuzheSHI/awesome-agi-cocosci/README.md)

### Science Logology / Laboratory Automation

*   [Robotic search for optimal cell culture in regenerative medicine](https://elifesciences.org/articles/77007) - ***eLife***, 2022. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1330075145723138159)]. This paper develops a robotic AI system with a batch Bayesian optimization algorithm that autonomously induces the differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived retinal pigment epithelial (iPSC-RPE) cells. From 200 million possible parameter combinations, the system performed cell culture in 143 different conditions in 111 days, resulting in 88% better iPSC-RPE production than that obtained by the pre-optimized culture in terms of the pigmentation scores.
