*   [.NET Conf: Building beautiful Blazor apps with Tailwind CSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIdedo8iI4Y) - ![duration](https://img.shields.io/badge/Duration:%20-39%20min-%230094FF?style=flat-square\&cacheSeconds=maxAge\&logo=youtube) November 18, 2023 - Tailwind CSS has been growing in popularity for some time. It’s fast becoming one of the top frameworks to use when styling applications. It offers a different approach to the traditional frameworks like Bootstrap—utility based styling. Rather than using prebuilt components—which result in your application looking like a lot of others on the web—you can tailor your design by applying small focused CSS classes resulting in a unique style for your app. In this code focused talk, you will learn how to bring the power of Tailwind CSS to your Blazor applications. We’ll start off with a brief introduction to Tailwind. Then we’ll get into some code and see how we can integrate Tailwind with Blazor. For the rest of the time, we’ll explore the various features of Tailwind and see just how beautiful we can make our Blazor app.
