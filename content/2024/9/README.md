## [35. Awesome Agi Cocosci](/content/YuzheSHI/awesome-agi-cocosci/week/README.md)

### Concepts / Human Concept Representation

*   [Locating what comes to mind in empirically derived representational spaces](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001002772300183X) - ***Cognition***, 2023. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=57834483230365927\&hl=en\&as_sdt=0,5)]. An evidence-based study concluding that people call category members to mind according to their location in representational space, specifically based on the predicted usefulness of considering category members with particular features.

### Concepts / AI Concept Representation

*   [Do Llamas Work in English? On the Latent Language of Multilingual Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10588) - 2024. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5847238732288003106\&hl=en\&as_sdt=0,5)]. A preliminary work empirically showing that the intermediate embeddings of multilingual Transformers (1) start far away from output token embeddings; (2) already allow for decoding a semantically correct next token in the middle layers, but give higher probability to its version in English than in the input language; (3) finally move into an input-language-specific region of the embedding space. Also, the embedding of abstract concept space lies closer to English than to other languages.

### Complexity & Information Theory / Visual Complexity

*   [Compressed File Length Predicts Search Time and Errors on Visual Displays](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141938205000120) - ***Displays***, 2005. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=15600966633648834042)]. Compressed file size, an objective, easily obtained measure of display complexity, predicts both subjective complexity judgments and objective search performance. It is analogous to algorithmic complexity, a theoretical but impractical measure of bit string complexity. The data suggest that it may be possible to use the compressed file size measure to predict display performance in applied tasks.

### Domain Specific Language / DSL Program Synthesis

*   [pix2code: Generating Code from a Graphical User Interface Screenshot](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3220134.3220135) - ***ACM SIGCHI Symposium on Engineering Interactive Computing Systems***, 2018. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=8296741513177971931)]. \[[Code (‚≠ê12k)](https://github.com/tonybeltramelli/pix2code)]. \[[Website](https://uizard.io/research/)]. This paper shows that deep learning methods can be leveraged to train a model end-to-end to automatically reverse engineer user interfaces and generate code from a single input image with over 77% of accuracy for three different platforms (i.e. iOS, Android and web-based technologies).

### Domain Specific Language / Cognitive Foundations

*   [Communicating Natural Programs to Humans and Machines](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/hash/182aed0379591ebd1d655b2bdc152075-Abstract-Datasets_and_Benchmarks.html) - ***NeurIPS'22***, 2022. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13381039702346039142)]. While humans readily generate and interpret instructions in a general language, computer systems are shackled to a narrow domain-specific language that they can precisely execute. This makes building intelligent systems that can generalize to novel situations such as ARC difficult. Human-generated instructions are referred as ‚Äúnatural programs‚Äù. While they resemble computer programs, they are distinct in two ways: First, they contain a wide range of primitives; Second, they frequently leverage communicative strategies beyond directly executable codes.

### Science Logology / Science of Science

*   [HCI Research as Problem-Solving](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2858036.2858283) - ***ACM SIGCHI'16***, 2016. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3206201064123443333\&as_sdt=0,5)]. This essay contributes a meta-scientific account of human-computer interaction (HCI) research as problem-solving. We build on the philosophy of Larry Laudan, who develops problem and solution as the foundational concepts of science. We argue that most HCI research is about three main types of problem: empirical, conceptual, and constructive.
