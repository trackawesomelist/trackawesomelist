### Abduction / Applications in AI

*   [Automated Biodesign Engineering by Abductive Meta-Interpretive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.07758) - ***AAAI Spring Symposium Series 2021 on Artificial Intelligence for Synthetic Biology***, 2021. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=543730388062329581)]. This work proposes an automated biodesign engineering framework empowered by Abductive Meta-Interpretive Learning (MetaAbd), a novel machine learning approach that combines symbolic and sub-symbolic machine learning, to further enhance the design-build-test-learn cycle by enabling the learning machine to 1) exploit domain knowledge and learn human-interpretable models that are expressed by formal languages such as first-order logic; 2) simultaneously optimise the structure and parameters of the models to make accurate numerical predictions; 3) reduce the cost of experiments and effort on data annotation by actively generating hypotheses and examples.
