## [4. Awesome Agi Cocosci](/content/YuzheSHI/awesome-agi-cocosci/README.md)

### Domain Specific Language / Design Practises

*   [No Grammar to Rule Them All: A Survey of JSON-style DSLs for Visualization](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9904438) - ***IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics***, 2022. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17206818917381447796)]. There has been substantial growth in the use of JSON-based grammars, as well as other standard data serialization languages, to create visualizations. Each of these grammars serves a purpose: some focus on particular computational tasks (such as animation), some are concerned with certain chart types (such as maps), and some target specific data domains (such as ML). Despite the prominence of this interface form, there has been little detailed analysis of the characteristics of these languages. This study surveys and analyzes the design and implementation of 57 JSON-style DSLs for visualization. The authors analyze these languages supported by a collected corpus of examples for each DSL (consisting of 4395 instances) across a variety of axes organized into concerns related to domain, conceptual model, language relationships, affordances, and general practicalities. The authors identify tensions throughout these areas, such as between formal and colloquial specifications, among types of users, and within the composition of languages. Through this work, the authors seek to support language implementers by elucidating the choices, opportunities, and tradeoffs in visualization DSL design.

## [5. Awesome Rust](/content/rust-unofficial/awesome-rust/README.md)
