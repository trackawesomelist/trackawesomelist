### Science Logology / Laboratory Automation

*   [A mobile robotic chemist](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2442-2) - ***Nature***, 2020. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13216902493789027324\&hl=en\&as_sdt=0,5)]. \[[Preprint](https://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/74759/1/Burger_etal_Nature_2020_A_mobile_robotic.pdf)]. This work uses a mobile robot to search for improved photocatalysts for hydrogen production from water. The robot operated autonomously over eight days, performing 688 experiments within a ten-variable experimental space, driven by a batched Bayesian search algorithm. This autonomous search identified photocatalyst mixtures that were six times more active than the initial formulations, selecting beneficial components and deselecting negative ones.
