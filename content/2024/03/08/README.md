## [5. Awesome Agi Cocosci](/content/YuzheSHI/awesome-agi-cocosci/README.md)

### Abduction / Applications in AI

*   [Human Comprehensible Active Learning of Genome-Scale Metabolic Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12740) - ***AAAI Spring Symposium Series 2023 on Computational Scientific Discovery***, 2023. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=10875437066608527790)]. \[[Extended Abstract](http://cogsys.org/symposium/discovery-2023/abstracts/Abstract_3169.pdf)]. \[[Slides](http://cogsys.org/symposium/discovery-2023/talks/Ai.pdf)]. This work introduces a novel machine learning framework ILP-iML1515 based on Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) that performs abductive logical reasoning and actively learns from training examples. The ILP-iML1515 framework 1) allows high-throughput simulations and 2) actively selects experiments that reduce the experimental cost of learning gene functions in comparison to randomly selected experiments.

### Domain Specific Language / Design Practises

*   [How Domain Experts Use an Embedded DSL](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3622851) - ***OOPSLA'23***, 2023. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=8416124186663074528)]. Programming tools are increasingly integral to research and analysis in myriad domains, including specialized areas with no formal relation to computer science. Embedded domain-specific languages (eDSLs) have the potential to serve these programmers while placing relatively light implementation burdens on language designers. However, barriers to eDSL use reduce their practical value and adoption. This work aims to deepen the understanding of how programmers use eDSLs and identify user needs to inform future eDSL designs. The authors performed a contextual inquiry (9 participants) with domain experts using Mimi, an eDSL for climate change economics modeling. A thematic analysis identified five key themes, including: the interaction between the eDSL and the host language has significant and sometimes unexpected impacts on eDSL user experience, and users preferentially engage with domain-specific communities and code templates rather than host language resources.
