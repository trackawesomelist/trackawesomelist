## [1. Awesome Agi Cocosci](/content/YuzheSHI/awesome-agi-cocosci/README.md)

### Complexity & Information Theory / Visual Complexity

*   [Compressed File Length Predicts Search Time and Errors on Visual Displays](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141938205000120) - ***Displays***, 2005. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=15600966633648834042)]. Compressed file size, an objective, easily obtained measure of display complexity, predicts both subjective complexity judgments and objective search performance. It is analogous to algorithmic complexity, a theoretical but impractical measure of bit string complexity. The data suggest that it may be possible to use the compressed file size measure to predict display performance in applied tasks.
