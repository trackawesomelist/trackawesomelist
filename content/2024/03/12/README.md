## [2. Awesome Agi Cocosci](/content/YuzheSHI/awesome-agi-cocosci/README.md)

### Meta-Level Considerations / Rationality

*   [Cognitive Science as a Source of Forward and Inverse Models of Human Decisions for Robotics and Control](https://cocosci.princeton.edu/papers/ho2022cognitive.pdf) - ***Annual Review of Control, Robotics, and Autonomous Systems***, 2022. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs\&cluster=14055765901243029337)]. The review focuses on how cognitive science can provide forward models of human decision-making and inverse models of how humans think about others‚Äô decision-making. The authors highlight relevant recent developments, including approaches that synthesize black box and theory-driven modeling, accounts that recast heuristics and biases as forms of bounded optimality, and models that characterize human theory of mind and communication in decision-theoretic terms.
