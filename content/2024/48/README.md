### Bayesian Modeling / Bayesian Induction

*   [Bayesian modeling of human concept learning](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/1998/hash/d010396ca8abf6ead8cacc2c2f2f26c7-Abstract.html) - ***NeurIPS'98***, 1998. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3772493362518191863)]. \[[Preprint](http://web.mit.edu/cocosci/archive/Papers/bayes.pdf)]. This work considers the problem of learning concepts from small numbers of positive examples, a feat which humans perform routinely but which computers are rarely capable of. Bridging machine learning and cognitive science perspectives, this work presents both theoretical analysis and an empirical study with human subjects for the simple task oflearning concepts corresponding to axis-aligned rectangles in a multidimensional feature space. Existing learning models, when applied to this task, cannot explain how subjects generalize from only a few examples of the concept. The author proposes a principled Bayesian model based on the assumption that the examples are a random sample from the concept to be learned. The model gives precise fits to human behavior on this simple task and provides qualitati ve insights into more complex, realistic cases of concept learning.
*   [Rules and Similarity in Concept Learning](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/1999/hash/86d7c8a08b4aaa1bc7c599473f5dddda-Abstract.html) - ***NeurIPS'99***, 1999. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=10968021160883668417)]. \[[Preprint](http://web.mit.edu/cocosci/archive/Papers/nips99preprint.pdf)]. This paper argues that two apparently distinct modes of generalizing concepts - abstracting rules and computing similarity to exemplars - should both be seen as special cases of a more general Bayesian learning framework. Bayes explains the specific workings of these two modes - which rules are abstracted, how similarity is measured - as well as why generalization should appear rule- or similarity-based in different situations. This analysis also suggests why the rules/similarity distinction, even if not computationally fundamental, may still be useful at the algorithmic level as part of a principled approximation to fully Bayesian learning.

### Domain Specific Language / Cognitive Foundations

*   [Symbolic metaprogram search improves learning efficiency and explains rule learning in humans](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50966-x) - ***Nature Communications***, 2024. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7670274141609367282)]. Symbolic models based on program learning successfully explain rule-learning in many domains, but performance degrades quickly as program complexity increases. It remains unclear how to scale symbolic rule-learning methods to model human performance in challenging domains. This work shows that symbolic search over the space of metaprograms‚Äîprograms that revise programs‚Äîdramatically improves learning efficiency. On a behavioral benchmark of 100 algorithmically rich rules, this approach fits human learning more accurately than alternative models while also using orders of magnitude less search. The computation required to match median human performance is consistent with conservative estimates of human thinking time. The results suggest that metaprogram-like representations may help human learners to efficiently acquire rules.
