## [1. Awesome Agi Cocosci](/content/YuzheSHI/awesome-agi-cocosci/README.md)

### Concepts / Human Concept Representation

*   [Semantic projection recovers rich human knowledge of multiple object features from word embeddings](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-022-01316-8) - ***Nature Human Behavior***, 2022. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2499199921371106654)]. \[[Preprint](https://cap.csail.mit.edu/sites/default/files/research-pdfs/Semantic%20projection%20recovers%20rich%20human%20knowledge%20of%20multiple%20object%20features%20from%20word%20embeddings.pdf)]. How is knowledge about word meaning represented in the mental lexicon? Current computational models infer word meanings from lexical co-occurrence patterns. They learn to represent words as vectors in a multidimensional space, wherein words that are used in more similar linguistic contexts‚Äîthat is, are more semantically related‚Äîare located closer together. However, whereas inter-word proximity captures only overall relatedness, human judgements are highly context dependent. For example, dolphins and alligators are similar in size but differ in dangerousness. This work proposes a domain-general method to extract context-dependent relationships from word embeddings: ‚Äòsemantic projection‚Äô of word-vectors onto lines that represent features such as size (the line connecting the words ‚Äòsmall‚Äô and ‚Äòbig‚Äô) or danger (‚Äòsafe‚Äô to ‚Äòdangerous‚Äô), analogous to ‚Äòmental scales‚Äô. This method recovers human judgements across various object categories and properties. Thus, the geometry of word embeddings explicitly represents a wealth of context-dependent world knowledge.
