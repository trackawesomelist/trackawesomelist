## [2. Awesome Agi Cocosci](/content/YuzheSHI/awesome-agi-cocosci/README.md)

### Bayesian Modeling / Bayesian Induction

*   [Building machines that learn and think with people](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-01991-9) - ***Nature Human Behavior***, 2024. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4420595706578245444)]. \[[Preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03943)]. This perspective shows how the science of collaborative cognition can be put to work to engineer systems that really can be called ‚Äòthought partners‚Äô, systems built to meet humans' expectations and complement humans' limitations. The authors lay out several modes of collaborative thought in which humans and artificial intelligence thought partners can engage, and they propose desiderata for human-compatible thought partnerships. Drawing on motifs from computational cognitive science, this work motivates an alternative scaling path for the design of thought partners and ecosystems around their use through a Bayesian lens, whereby the constructed partners actively build and reason over models of the human and world.
