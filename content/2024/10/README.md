## [39. Awesome Agi Cocosci](/content/YuzheSHI/awesome-agi-cocosci/week/README.md)

### Abduction / Applications in AI

*   [Human Comprehensible Active Learning of Genome-Scale Metabolic Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12740) - ***AAAI Spring Symposium Series 2023 on Computational Scientific Discovery***, 2023. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs\&cluster=10875437066608527790)]. \[[Extended Abstract](http://cogsys.org/symposium/discovery-2023/abstracts/Abstract_3169.pdf)]. \[[Slides](http://cogsys.org/symposium/discovery-2023/talks/Ai.pdf)]. This work introduces a novel machine learning framework ILP-iML1515 based on Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) that performs abductive logical reasoning and actively learns from training examples. The ILP-iML1515 framework 1) allows high-throughput simulations and 2) actively selects experiments that reduce the experimental cost of learning gene functions in comparison to randomly selected experiments.

### Domain Specific Language / Design Practises

*   [How Domain Experts Use an Embedded DSL](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3622851) - ***OOPSLA'23***, 2023. This work conducts a thematic analysis identified five key themes, including: the interaction between the eDSL and the host language has significant and sometimes unexpected impacts on eDSL user experience, and users preferentially engage with domain-specific communities and code templates rather than host language resources.

### Domain Specific Language / DSL Program Synthesis

*   [Learning to Infer Graphics Programs from Hand-Drawn Images](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2018/hash/6788076842014c83cedadbe6b0ba0314-Abstract.html) - ***NeurIPS'18***, 2018. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14065112485794121024\&as_sdt=0,5)]. The method learns a model that uses program synthesis techniques to recover a graphics program from drawing primitives. These programs have constructs like variable bindings, iterative loops, or simple kinds of conditionals. With a graphics program in hand, we can correct errors made by the deep network and extrapolate drawings.
*   [babble: Learning Better Abstractions with E-Graphs and Anti-unification](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3571207) - ***POPL'23***, 2023. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7935064016901049715\&as_sdt=0,5)]. This paper proposes library learning modulo theory (LLMT), a new library learning algorithm that additionally takes as input an equational theory for a given problem domain. LLMT uses e-graphs and equality saturation to compactly represent the space of programs equivalent modulo the theory, and uses a novel e-graph anti-unification technique to find common patterns in the corpus more directly and efficiently.

### Inductive Logic & Program Synthesis / Commonsense Knowledgebase

*   [Large Language Models for Software Engineering: A
    Systematic Literature Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10620) - 2023. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=10466731638053452642\&as_sdt=0,5)].
