### Abduction / Applications in AI

*   [Human Comprehensible Active Learning of Genome-Scale Metabolic Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12740) - ***AAAI Spring Symposium Series 2023 on Computational Scientific Discovery***, 2023. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=10875437066608527790)]. \[[Extended Abstract](http://cogsys.org/symposium/discovery-2023/abstracts/Abstract_3169.pdf)]. \[[Slides](http://cogsys.org/symposium/discovery-2023/talks/Ai.pdf)]. This work introduces a novel machine learning framework ILP-iML1515 based on Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) that performs abductive logical reasoning and actively learns from training examples. The ILP-iML1515 framework 1) allows high-throughput simulations and 2) actively selects experiments that reduce the experimental cost of learning gene functions in comparison to randomly selected experiments.

### Domain Specific Language / Design Practises

*   [How Domain Experts Use an Embedded DSL](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3622851) - ***OOPSLA'23***, 2023. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=8416124186663074528)]. Programming tools are increasingly integral to research and analysis in myriad domains, including specialized areas with no formal relation to computer science. Embedded domain-specific languages (eDSLs) have the potential to serve these programmers while placing relatively light implementation burdens on language designers. However, barriers to eDSL use reduce their practical value and adoption. This work aims to deepen the understanding of how programmers use eDSLs and identify user needs to inform future eDSL designs. The authors performed a contextual inquiry (9 participants) with domain experts using Mimi, an eDSL for climate change economics modeling. A thematic analysis identified five key themes, including: the interaction between the eDSL and the host language has significant and sometimes unexpected impacts on eDSL user experience, and users preferentially engage with domain-specific communities and code templates rather than host language resources.

### Domain Specific Language / Declarative DSL Applications

*   [Scenic: a language for scenario specification and data generation](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10994-021-06120-5) - ***Machine Learning***, 2022. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13790565080942515865)]. This paper proposes a domain-specific language, Scenic, for describing scenarios that are distributions over scenes and the behaviors of their agents over time. Scenic combines concise, readable syntax for spatiotemporal relationships with the ability to declaratively impose hard and soft constraints over the scenario.

### Domain Specific Language / DSL Program Synthesis

*   [Learning to Infer Graphics Programs from Hand-Drawn Images](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2018/hash/6788076842014c83cedadbe6b0ba0314-Abstract.html) - ***NeurIPS'18***, 2018. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14065112485794121024)]. The method learns a model that uses program synthesis techniques to recover a graphics program from drawing primitives. These programs have constructs like variable bindings, iterative loops, or simple kinds of conditionals. With a graphics program in hand, we can correct errors made by the deep network and extrapolate drawings.
*   [babble: Learning Better Abstractions with E-Graphs and Anti-unification](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3571207) - ***POPL'23***, 2023. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7935064016901049715)]. This paper proposes library learning modulo theory (LLMT), a new library learning algorithm that additionally takes as input an equational theory for a given problem domain. LLMT uses e-graphs and equality saturation to compactly represent the space of programs equivalent modulo the theory, and uses a novel e-graph anti-unification technique to find common patterns in the corpus more directly and efficiently.
