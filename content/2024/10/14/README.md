The proposed Bayesian model of ToM (or BToM) expresses the predictive model of belief- and desire-dependent action at the heart of ToM as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), and reconstructs an agent‚Äôs joint belief state and reward function using Bayesian inference, conditioned on observations of the agent‚Äôs behavior in some environmental context.
