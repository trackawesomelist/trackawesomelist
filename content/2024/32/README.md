### Domain Specific Language / Declarative DSL Applications

*   [Product Line Engineering Using Domain-Specific Languages](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6030048) - ***ISPLC'11***, 2011. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17589685299346185442)]. \[[Preprint](https://voelter.de/data/pub/VoelterVisser-PLEusingDSLs.pdf)]. This paper investigates the application of domain-specific languages in product line engineering (PLE). It starts by analyzing the limits of expressivity of feature models. Feature models correspond to context-free grammars without recursion, which prevents the expression of multiple instances and references. The authors then show how domain-specific languages (DSLs) can serve as a middle ground between feature modeling and programming. They can be used in cases where feature models are too limited, while keeping the separation between problem space and solution space provided by feature models. This work then categorizes useful combinations between configuration with feature model and construction with DSLs and provide an integration of DSLs into the conceptual framework of PLE. Finally the authors show how use of a consistent, unified formalism for models, code, and configuration can yield important benefits for managing variability and trace ability.
*   [A Domain-Specific Language for Product-Process-Resource Modeling](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9613674) - ***ETFA'21***, 2021. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=6006131184799036515)]. This paper presents the design of the PPR-DSL to effectively and efficiently represent Product-Process-Resource (PPR) aspects and evaluate constraints defined for modeling PPR views in the Formalized Process Description standard (VDI 3682).

### Science Logology / AI Assisted Research

*   [A human-machine interface for automatic exploration of chemical reaction networks](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-47997-9) - ***Nature Communications***, 2024. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13306522324804014261)]. Autonomous reaction network exploration algorithms offer a systematic approach to explore mechanisms of complex chemical processes. However, the resulting reaction networks are so vast that an exploration of all potentially accessible intermediates is computationally too demanding. This paper introduces a STEERING WHEEL to guide an otherwise unbiased automated exploration. The STEERING WHEEL algorithm is intuitive, generally applicable, and enables one to focus on specific regions of an emerging network. It also allows for guiding automated data generation in the context of mechanism exploration, catalyst design, and other chemical optimization challenges.
