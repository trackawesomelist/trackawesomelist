### Strategy

### [Gorgasali: Battle Royale](hhttps://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/289351/gorgasali-battle-royale)

> Gorgasali: Battle Royale is a role-playing board game based mainly on the concept of battle royale. The story of the game is fictional, and the game mechanics - completely unique. Start the game from the sector and enter the map through the gate. Scroll through the map and try to open the boxes to collect the cards needed for the fight. Engage in battle with an opponent to knock him out of the game and earn his own cards. Higher strength cards give you a better chance of winning. Be careful with the reducing of the zone, due to having less space to navigate without taking damage. To win the game you must be the only surviving player on the map.

### Domain Specific Language / Declarative DSL Applications

*   [A Domain-Specific Language for Product-Process-Resource Modeling](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9613674) - ***ETFA'21***, 2021. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=6006131184799036515)].

### Science Logology / AI Assisted Research

*   [A human-machine interface for automatic exploration of chemical reaction networks](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-47997-9) - ***Nature Communications***, 2024. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13306522324804014261)]. Autonomous reaction network exploration algorithms offer a systematic approach to explore mechanisms of complex chemical processes. However, the resulting reaction networks are so vast that an exploration of all potentially accessible intermediates is computationally too demanding. This paper introduces a STEERING WHEEL to guide an otherwise unbiased automated exploration. The STEERING WHEEL algorithm is intuitive, generally applicable, and enables one to focus on specific regions of an emerging network. It also allows for guiding automated data generation in the context of mechanism exploration, catalyst design, and other chemical optimization challenges.
