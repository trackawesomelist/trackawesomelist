Smart contracts play a vital role in many fields. Despite being called smart, the development of smart contracts is a tedious task beyond defining a set of contractual rules. In addition to business knowledge, coding a smart contract requires strong technical knowledge in a multiplex of new and rapidly changing domain-specific languages and blockchain platforms. The goal of this paper is to assist developers in building smart contracts independently from the language or the target blockchain platform. In which, this paper presents the second-generation smart contract language iContractML 2.0. iContractML 2.0 is an extensible framework that empowers developers to model and generate functional smart contract code that can be deployed onto multiple blockchain platforms.
