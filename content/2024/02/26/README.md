### Concepts / Human Concept Representation

*   [Locating what comes to mind in empirically derived representational spaces](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001002772300183X) - ***Cognition***, 2023. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=57834483230365927\&hl=en\&as_sdt=0,5)]. An evidence-based study concluding that people call category members to mind according to their location in representational space, specifically based on the predicted usefulness of considering category members with particular features.

### Concepts / AI Concept Representation

*   [Do Llamas Work in English? On the Latent Language of Multilingual Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10588) - 2024. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5847238732288003106\&hl=en\&as_sdt=0,5)]. A preliminary work empirically showing that the intermediate embeddings of multilingual Transformers (1) start far away from output token embeddings; (2) already allow for decoding a semantically correct next token in the middle layers, but give higher probability to its version in English than in the input language; (3) finally move into an input-language-specific region of the embedding space. Also, the embedding of abstract concept space lies closer to English than to other languages.
