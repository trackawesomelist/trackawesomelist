Full source code and data provided in the [GitHub repo (‚≠ê9)](https://github.com/tractorjuice/STMemGPT). Recall Memory: This is my short-term memory where I keep recent interactions. Core Memory: This is where I store key details about my persona and about you, the user. This gives me a 'personality' and allows for more personalized conversation. Archival Memory: This is my long-term memory where I store information that doesn't fit into core memory but is essential to remember. It's infinite in size, and I usually page through it to find answers to your questions. These parts work together to help the AI Assistant remember prior engagements, learn from them, and refer back when needed.
