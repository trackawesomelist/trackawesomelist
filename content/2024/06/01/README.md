*   [yazi-zoxide (‚≠ê5)](https://github.com/fdw/yazi-zoxide-zsh) - This plugin for [zsh](https://www.zsh.org) adds just one shortcut, but unfolds the magic of both [Zoxide (‚≠ê25k)](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide) and [yazi (‚≠ê23k)](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi/). Without arguments, `y` just opens yazi. If you supply an argument that is a directory, `yazi` is opened in that directory. But if you supply anything else as an argument, `zoxide` is called with the argument and `yazi` is opened there.
