This paper introduces a transformer model for automated synthesis protocol analysis in catalyst discovery, exemplified using single-atom heterogeneous catalysts (SACs), a rapidly expanding catalyst family. The model adeptly converts SAC protocols into action sequences, and this output is used to facilitate statistical inference of their synthesis trends and applications, potentially expediting literature review and analysis.

### Science Logology / Laboratory Automation

This work employs ontologies to capture data and material flows in design-make-test-analyse cycles, utilising autonomous agents as executable knowledge components to carry out the experimentation workflow. Data provenance is recorded to ensure its findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability. The architecture is built upon the World Avatar project, which seeks to create an all-encompassing digital twin based on a dynamic knowledge graph.

The development of AI synthesis planners trained solely on reaction-example-data has stagnated and is not on par with the performance of ‚Äúhybrid‚Äù algorithms combining AI with expert knowledge. This Perspective examines possible causes of these shortcomings, extending beyond the established reasoning of insufficient quantities of reaction data. The authors advocate augmenting the unique capabilities of AI with the knowledge base and the reasoning strategies of domain experts.

### Causality / AI Assisted Research

*   [How do people generalize causal relations over objects? A non-parametric Bayesian account](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42113-021-00124-z) - ***Computational Brain & Behavior***, 2022. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3364672295201228487)]. \[[Preprint](https://psyarxiv.com/x57hf/)]. How do people decide how general a causal relationship is, in terms of the entities or situations it applies to? What features do people use to decide whether a new situation is governed by a new causal law or an old one? How can people make these difficult judgments in a fast, efficient way? This paper addresses these questions in two experiments that ask participants to generalize from one (Experiment 1) or several (Experiment 2) causal interactions between pairs of objects. In each case, participants see an agent object act on a recipient object, causing some changes to the recipient.

### Commonsense / AI Commonsense Reasoning

This paper presents Sherlock, an annotated corpus of 103K images for testing machine capacity for abductive reasoning beyond literal image contents. The corpus construction process adopts a free-viewing paradigm: participants first observe and identify salient clues within images (e.g., objects, actions) and then provide a plausible inference about the scene, given the clue.
*   [UNcommonsense Reasoning: Abductive Reasoning about Uncommon Situations](https://aclanthology.org/2024.naacl-long.469/) - ***NAACL'24***, 2024. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=470445696014235795)]. This paper explores the task of uncommonsense abductive reasoning. Given a piece of context with an unexpected outcome, this task requires reasoning abductively to generate an explanation that makes the unexpected outcome more likely in the context.

The first pawn to reach the opposite side wins.
