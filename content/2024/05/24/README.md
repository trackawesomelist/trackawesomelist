### Videos / Others

*   [Clean Architecture with .NET MAUI, Blazor, and ASP.NET Core](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9YNufaYxzM) - ![duration](https://img.shields.io/badge/Duration:%20-67%20min-%230094FF?style=flat-square\&cacheSeconds=maxAge\&logo=youtube) May 22, 2024 - We've heard a lot about how using .NET to build our UI applications lets us share code across our whole stack, but finding the best way to do this isn't straightforward. UI code and API code can sometimes seem at cross-purposes and it's not always obvious how using .NET code across your whole stack provides any advantages over using different technologies for your UI and API. It's easy to fall into the trap of underutilizing the right code-sharing techniques. Or, at the other extreme, butchering your architecture for the sake of sharing code. In this talk, Matt Goldman (author of .NET MAUI in Action) will look at extending Clean Architecture to incorporate UIs built with .NET MAUI and Blazor. See sensible ways to write clean, testable, re-usable code that can be shared across the different layers of your solution, and across different solutions in your enterprise, to optimize efficiency and minimize duplication. We'll also see how to avoid the common pitfalls of over-engineering or under-sharing. You will walk away knowing how to make full-stack code shared with .NET a reality.
*   [Supercharging Blazor SSR with htmx](https://www.youtube.com/live/-Mc9pROA0Ho) - ![duration](https://img.shields.io/badge/Duration:%20-60%20min-%230094FF?style=flat-square\&cacheSeconds=maxAge\&logo=youtube) April 29, 2024 - Are you using a front-end framework with Blazor? In this week's episode, community MVP Egin Hansen shows us how to supercharge Blazor static server-side rendering (SSR) with the htmx front-end library. Adding htmx gives you access to another level of interactivity while still retaining all the advantages of Blazor SSR stateless nature.
