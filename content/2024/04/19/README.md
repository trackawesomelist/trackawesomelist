## [3. Awesome Azure Openai Llm](/content/kimtth/awesome-azure-openai-llm/README.md)

### **RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) & SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning)** / **Llama 2 Finetuning**

*   [Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18290): \[[cnt](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en\&as_sdt=0%2C5\&q=arxiv%3A+2305.18290)]: 1. RLHF can be complex because it requires fitting a reward model and performing significant hyperparameter tuning. On the other hand, DPO directly solves a classification problem on human preference data in just one stage of policy training. DPO more stable, efficient, and computationally lighter than RLHF. 2. `Your Language Model Is Secretly a Reward Model`  \[29 May 2023]
    *   Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) uses two models: a trained model (or policy model) and a reference model (copy of trained model). The goal is to have the trained model output higher probabilities for preferred answers and lower probabilities for rejected answers compared to the reference model.
