## [4. Awesome Agi Cocosci](/content/YuzheSHI/awesome-agi-cocosci/README.md)

### Domain Specific Language / Imperative DSL Applications

*   [Universal chemical programming language for robotic synthesis repeatability](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44160-023-00473-6) - ***Nature Synthesis***, 2024. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3455106495990439366)]. \[[Preprint](https://www.chem.gla.ac.uk/cronin/images/pubs/rauschen-natsynthesisjan24.pdf)]. This paper presents an approach that uses a universal chemical programming language (œáDL) to encode and execute synthesis procedures for a variety of chemical reactions, including reductive amination, ring formation, esterification, carbon‚Äìcarbon bond formation and amide coupling on four different hardware systems in two laboratories. With around 50 lines of code per reaction, the approach uses abstraction to efficiently compress chemical protocols.
