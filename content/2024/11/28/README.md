## [5. Awesome Agi Cocosci](/content/YuzheSHI/awesome-agi-cocosci/README.md)

### Domain Specific Language / Cognitive Foundations

*   [Symbolic metaprogram search improves learning efficiency and explains rule learning in humans](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50966-x) - ***Nature Communications***, 2024. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7670274141609367282)]. Symbolic models based on program learning successfully explain rule-learning in many domains, but performance degrades quickly as program complexity increases. It remains unclear how to scale symbolic rule-learning methods to model human performance in challenging domains. This work shows that symbolic search over the space of metaprograms‚Äîprograms that revise programs‚Äîdramatically improves learning efficiency. On a behavioral benchmark of 100 algorithmically rich rules, this approach fits human learning more accurately than alternative models while also using orders of magnitude less search. The computation required to match median human performance is consistent with conservative estimates of human thinking time. The results suggest that metaprogram-like representations may help human learners to efficiently acquire rules.
