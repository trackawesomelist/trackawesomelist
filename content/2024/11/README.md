### Abduction / Applications in AI

*   [Automated Biodesign Engineering by Abductive Meta-Interpretive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.07758) - ***AAAI Spring Symposium Series 2021 on Artificial Intelligence for Synthetic Biology***, 2021. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=543730388062329581)]. This work proposes an automated biodesign engineering framework empowered by Abductive Meta-Interpretive Learning (MetaAbd), a novel machine learning approach that combines symbolic and sub-symbolic machine learning, to further enhance the design-build-test-learn cycle by enabling the learning machine to 1) exploit domain knowledge and learn human-interpretable models that are expressed by formal languages such as first-order logic; 2) simultaneously optimise the structure and parameters of the models to make accurate numerical predictions; 3) reduce the cost of experiments and effort on data annotation by actively generating hypotheses and examples.

### Domain Specific Language / Declarative DSL Applications

*   [PClean: Bayesian Data Cleaning at Scale with Domain-Specific Probabilistic Programming](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v130/lew21a.html) - ***ICML'21***, 2021. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2892523061439714130)]. This work presents PClean, a probabilistic programming language (PPL) for leveraging dataset-specific knowledge to automate Bayesian cleaning, automating Bayesian approaches given the diversity of real-world error patterns and the hardness of inference.

### Meta-Level Considerations / Rationality

*   [Cognitive Science as a Source of Forward and Inverse Models of Human Decisions for Robotics and Control](https://cocosci.princeton.edu/papers/ho2022cognitive.pdf) - ***Annual Review of Control, Robotics, and Autonomous Systems***, 2022. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs\&cluster=14055765901243029337)]. The review focuses on how cognitive science can provide forward models of human decision-making and inverse models of how humans think about others‚Äô decision-making. The authors highlight relevant recent developments, including approaches that synthesize black box and theory-driven modeling, accounts that recast heuristics and biases as forms of bounded optimality, and models that characterize human theory of mind and communication in decision-theoretic terms.

### Science Logology / Laboratory Automation

*   [A mobile robotic chemist](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2442-2) - ***Nature***, 2020. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13216902493789027324\&hl=en\&as_sdt=0,5)]. \[[Preprint](https://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/74759/1/Burger_etal_Nature_2020_A_mobile_robotic.pdf)]. This work uses a mobile robot to search for improved photocatalysts for hydrogen production from water. The robot operated autonomously over eight days, performing 688 experiments within a ten-variable experimental space, driven by a batched Bayesian search algorithm. This autonomous search identified photocatalyst mixtures that were six times more active than the initial formulations, selecting beneficial components and deselecting negative ones.

A new algorithm that synthesizes functional reactive programs from observation data, which iterates between a functional synthesis step, which attempts to generate a transition function over observed states, and an automata synthesis step, which adds any additional latent state necessary to fully account for the observations.
