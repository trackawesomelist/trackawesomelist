### Meta-Level Considerations / Rationality

*   [Understanding Human Intelligence through Human Limitations](https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613\(20\)30215-1) - ***Trends in Cognitive Sciences***, 2020. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs\&hl=en\&cluster=6469796133334580403)]. \[[Preprint](https://cocosci.princeton.edu/papers/griffiths_understanding.pdf)]. Recent progress in artificial intelligence provides the opportunity to ask the question of what is unique about human intelligence, but with a new comparison class. The author argues that we can understand human intelligence, and the ways in which it may differ from artificial intelligence, by considering the characteristics of the kind of computational problems that human minds have to solve. The author claims that these problems acquire their structure from three fundamental limitations that apply to human beings: limited time, limited computation, and limited communication. From these limitations we can derive many of the properties we associate with human intelligence, such as rapid learning, the ability to break down problems into parts, and the capacity for cumulative cultural evolution.
