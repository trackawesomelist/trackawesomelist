## [2. Awesome Agi Cocosci](/content/YuzheSHI/awesome-agi-cocosci/README.md)

### Domain Specific Language / Cognitive Foundations

*   [The Child as Hacker](https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613\(20\)30174-1) - ***Trends in Cognitive Sciences***, 2020. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13128656954836679743)]. The scope of human learning and development poses a radical challenge for cognitive science. The authors propose that developmental theories can address this challenge by adopting perspectives from computer science. Many of our best models treat learning as analogous to computer programming because symbolic programs provide the most compelling account of sophisticated mental representations. The authors specifically propose that children‚Äôs learning is analogous to a particular style of programming called hacking, making code better along many dimensions through an open-ended set of goals and activities. By contrast to existing theories, which depend primarily on local search and simple metrics, this view highlights the many features of good mental representations and the multiple complementary processes children use to create them.
