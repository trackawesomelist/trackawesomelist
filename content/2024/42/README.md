### Theory of Mind / AI Assisted Research

*   [Bayesian Theory of Mind: Modeling Joint Belief-Desire Attribution](https://escholarship.org/content/qt5rk7z59q/qt5rk7z59q.pdf) - ***CogSci'11***, 2011. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7454981153033683025)]. \[[Preprint](http://web.mit.edu/9.s915/www/classes/theoryOfMind.pdf)]. This paper presents a computational framework for understanding Theory of Mind (ToM): the human capacity for reasoning about agents‚Äô mental states such as beliefs and desires. The proposed Bayesian model of ToM (or BToM) expresses the predictive model of belief- and desire-dependent action at the heart of ToM as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), and reconstructs an agent‚Äôs joint belief state and reward function using Bayesian inference, conditioned on observations of the agent‚Äôs behavior in some environmental context.
*   [AGENT: A Benchmark for Core Psychological Reasoning](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/shu21a.html) - ***ICML'21***, 2021. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9729067071974484204)]. Inspired by cognitive development studies on intuitive psychology, this paper presents a benchmark consisting of a large dataset of procedurally generated 3D animations, AGENT (Action, Goal, Efficiency, coNstraint, uTility), structured around four scenarios (goal preferences, action efficiency, unobserved constraints, and cost-reward trade-offs) that probe key concepts of core intuitive psychology. The results suggest that to pass the designed tests of core intuitive psychology at human levels, a model must acquire or have built-in representations of how agents plan, combining utility computations and core knowledge of objects and physics.
