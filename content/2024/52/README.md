### Communications / Pragmatics

*   [Predicting Pragmatic Reasoning in Language Games](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.1218633) - ***Science***, 2012. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=15533081031935746054)]. \[[Preprint](https://langcog.stanford.edu/papers_new/frank-2012-science.pdf)]. One of the most astonishing features of human language is its capacity to convey information efficiently in context. Many theories provide informal accounts of communicative inference, yet there have been few successes in making precise, quantitative predictions about pragmatic reasoning. This work examined judgments about simple referential communication games, modeling behavior in these games by assuming that speakers attempt to be informative and that listeners use Bayesian inference to recover speakers‚Äô intended referents. The model provides a close, parameter-free fit to human judgments, suggesting that the use of information-theoretic tools to predict pragmatic reasoning may lead to more effective formal models of communication.
*   [Language as shaped by the environment: linguistic construal in a collaborative spatial task](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-020-0404-9) - ***Humanities and Social Sciences Communications***, 2020. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7842508027049437987)]. \[[Code & Data](https://osf.io/sxtaq)]. \[[Dialogue Experimental Toolkit(DiET)](https://dialoguetoolkit.github.io/chattool/)]. The present study sets out to experimentally investigate how environmental factors come to shape the emergence of linguistic conventions. To this end, the authors adapt the classical Maze Game task to test the hypothesis that participants routinise different linguistic strategies to communicate positions in the maze contingent on particular environmental affordances (i.e. structure of the mazes). The results confirm that subtle environmental motivations drive the emergence of different communicative conventions in an otherwise identical task, suggesting that linguistic adaptations are highly sensitive to factors of the shared task environment.
