### Theory of Mind / AI Assisted Research

*   [The na√Øve utility calculus: Computational principles underlying commonsense psychology](https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613\(16\)30053-5) - ***Trends in Cognitive Sciences***, 2016. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=6894095575934067763)]. \[[Preprint](http://sll.stanford.edu/docs/2016_JaraEttinger_Gweon_Schulz_Tenenbaum_TiCS.pdf)]. This review article proposes that human social cognition is structured around a basic understanding of ourselves and others as intuitive utility maximizers: from a young age, humans implicitly assume that agents choose goals and actions to maximize the rewards they expect to obtain relative to the costs they expect to incur. This ‚Äòna√Øve utility calculus‚Äô allows both children and adults observe the behavior of others and infer their beliefs and desires, their longer-term knowledge and preferences, and even their character: who is knowledgeable or competent, who is praiseworthy or blameworthy, who is friendly, indifferent, or an enemy.
*   [Planning with theory of mind](https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613\(22\)00185-1) - ***Trends in Cognitive Sciences***, 2022. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=8461125353366208047)]. \[[Preprint](https://saxelab.mit.edu/sites/default/files/publications/HoSaxeCushman2022.pdf)]. A perspective on understanding Theory of Mind through planning that consists of abstract structured causal representations and supports efficient search and selection from innumerable possible actions. Planning requires that Theory of Mind consists of abstract structured causal representations and supports efficient search and selection from innumerable possible actions. Theory of Mind contrasts with less cognitively demanding alternatives: statistical predictive models of other people‚Äôs actions, or model-free reinforcement of actions by their effects on other people. Theory of Mind is likely used to plan novel interventions and predict their effects, for example, in pedagogy, emotion regulation, and impression management.
*   [Learning Triadic Belief Dynamics in Nonverbal Communication from Videos](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/html/Fan_Learning_Triadic_Belief_Dynamics_in_Nonverbal_Communication_From_Videos_CVPR_2021_paper.html) - ***CVPR'21***, 2021. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=15365483338824697316)]. \[[Preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02841)]. This paper incorporates different nonverbal communication cues (e.g., gaze, human poses, and gestures) to represent, model, learn, and infer agents' mental states from pure visual inputs. Crucially, such a mental representation takes the agent's belief into account so that it represents what the true world state is and infers the beliefs in each agent's mental state, which may differ from the true world states. By aggregating different beliefs and true world states, the model essentially forms "five minds" during the interactions between two agents. This "five minds" model differs from prior works that infer beliefs in an infinite recursion; instead, agents' beliefs are converged into a "common mind". Based on this representation, this work further devises a hierarchical energy-based model that jointly tracks and predicts all five minds. From this new perspective, a social event is interpreted by a series of nonverbal communication and belief dynamics, which transcends the classic keyframe video summary.
