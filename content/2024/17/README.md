It’s 2024, and the web continues to dominate the software landscape. Innovation proceeds in all directions, with new frameworks, build systems, and architectural patterns emerging at pace. But where are we all heading? Is there a pattern? What’s the next big phase? In this demo-centric talk we’ll look at the common trends across web frameworks: disruptive new features that are showing up across technologies and changing how web apps are built. We’ll dig into live code examples in Next.js (React), SvelteKit, Blazor, Astro, and more. We’ll see how these and others are setting a similar path for the next phase of web technology – and how you could implement the same features yourself without any framework. Finally, we’ll catch up on the state of WebAssembly and try out WASI preview 2 – the upcoming reinvention of WASI. Will it achieve the dream of seamless interop across all languages, operating systems, and CPU architectures? Will it become the standard for server-side cloud programming? Let’s build something with it.
*   [ASP.NET Community Standup: Blazor Hybrid + Web in .NET 9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrXAkNsjaoI\&list=PLdo4fOcmZ0oX-DBuRG4u58ZTAJgBAeQ-t\&index=9) - ![duration](https://img.shields.io/badge/Duration:%20-61%20min-%230094FF?style=flat-square\&cacheSeconds=maxAge\&logo=youtube) April 9, 2024 - Learn how improvements coming to .NET 9 will make it easier to integrate Blazor Web and Blazor Hybrid.

In this episode, we continue that journey to cover disconnected scenarios. That is, where the entity travels to a client and then back to the server before being updated in the database. We’ll look at the different patterns for doing updates like this in ASP.NET Core and Blazor apps and see how concurrency tokens work with each of these. We’ll also look at how `ExecuteUpdate` can be used with concurrency tokens, and take a look at ETag concurrency in Azure Cosmos DB.

When carefully selected and used, Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) may simplify complex code, promote effective communication with customers, improve productivity, and unclog development bottlenecks. In Domain-Specific Languages, noted software development expert Martin Fowler first provides the information software professionals need to decide if and when to utilize DSLs. Then, where DSLs prove suitable, Fowler presents effective techniques for building them, and guides software engineers in choosing the right approaches for their applications.
