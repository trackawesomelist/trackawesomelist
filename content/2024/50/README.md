*   [When and How to Develop Domain-Specific Languages](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1118890.1118892) - ***ACM Computing Surveys***, 2005. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=8598236436890577027)]. \[[Preprint](https://people.cs.ksu.edu/~schmidt/505f14/Lectures/WhenDSL.pdf)]. Domain-specific languages (DSLs) are languages tailored to a specific application domain. They offer substantial gains in expressiveness and ease of use compared with general-purpose programming languages in their domain of application. DSL development is hard, requiring both domain knowledge and language development expertise. Few people have both. Not surprisingly, the decision to develop a DSL is often postponed indefinitely, if considered at all, and most DSLs never get beyond the application library stage. Although many articles have been written on the development of particular DSLs, there is very limited literature on DSL development methodologies and many questions remain regarding when and how to develop a DSL. To aid the DSL developer, this survey paper identifies patterns in the decision, analysis, design, and implementation phases of DSL development. These patterns improve and extend earlier work on DSL design patterns.
