### Domain Specific Language / Design Practises

*   [No Grammar to Rule Them All: A Survey of JSON-style DSLs for Visualization](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9904438) - ***IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics***, 2022. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17206818917381447796)]. A survey on the design and implementation of 57 JSON-style DSLs for a variety of visualization and visual interaction tasks, suggesting that no one DSL will be able to capture all of them without compromising essential parts of its domain design.

### Domain Specific Language / Imperative DSL Applications

*   [OpenLaw](https://docs.openlaw.io/) - ***OpenLaw\.io***. It is now possible to model all or parts of legal agreements using code (smart contracts), decreasing the cost and friction of creating, securing, and generating binding legal agreements. Lawyers lack basic tools to build these dynamic, “smart” contracts in a way that is enforceable and understandable to a legal professional. OpenLaw is a technology stack to help power next generation "smart" legal agreements, with a domain-specific markup language, a integration framework, and a series of general applications.

### Domain Specific Language / DSL Program Synthesis

*   [Errors are Useful Prompts: Instruction Guided Task Programming with Verifier-Assisted Iterative Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14100) - 2023. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=8063693456660536915)]. \[[Code (⭐33)](https://github.com/ac-rad/xdl-generation)]. \[[Website](https://ac-rad.github.io/clairify/)]. This paper proposes CLAIRIFY, an approach that combines automatic iterative prompting with program verification to ensure programs written in data-scarce domain-specific language are syntactically valid and incorporate environment constraints.
