### Domain Specific Language / Design Practises

*   [No Grammar to Rule Them All: A Survey of JSON-style DSLs for Visualization](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9904438) - ***IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics***, 2022. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17206818917381447796)]. There has been substantial growth in the use of JSON-based grammars, as well as other standard data serialization languages, to create visualizations. Each of these grammars serves a purpose: some focus on particular computational tasks (such as animation), some are concerned with certain chart types (such as maps), and some target specific data domains (such as ML). Despite the prominence of this interface form, there has been little detailed analysis of the characteristics of these languages. This study surveys and analyzes the design and implementation of 57 JSON-style DSLs for visualization. The authors analyze these languages supported by a collected corpus of examples for each DSL (consisting of 4395 instances) across a variety of axes organized into concerns related to domain, conceptual model, language relationships, affordances, and general practicalities. The authors identify tensions throughout these areas, such as between formal and colloquial specifications, among types of users, and within the composition of languages. Through this work, the authors seek to support language implementers by elucidating the choices, opportunities, and tradeoffs in visualization DSL design.

### Domain Specific Language / Declarative DSL Applications

*   [OpenLaw](https://docs.openlaw.io/) - ***OpenLaw\.io***. It is now possible to model all or parts of legal agreements using code (smart contracts), decreasing the cost and friction of creating, securing, and generating binding legal agreements. Lawyers lack basic tools to build these dynamic, ‚Äúsmart‚Äù contracts in a way that is enforceable and understandable to a legal professional. OpenLaw is a technology stack to help power next generation "smart" legal agreements, with a domain-specific markup language, a integration framework, and a series of general applications.

### Domain Specific Language / DSL Program Synthesis

*   [Errors are Useful Prompts: Instruction Guided Task Programming with Verifier-Assisted Iterative Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14100) - 2023. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=8063693456660536915)]. \[[Project (‚≠ê43)](https://github.com/ac-rad/xdl-generation)]. \[[Website](https://ac-rad.github.io/clairify/)]. This paper proposes CLAIRIFY, an approach that combines automatic iterative prompting with program verification to ensure programs written in data-scarce domain-specific language are syntactically valid and incorporate environment constraints.

## [42. Awesome Zsh Plugins](/content/unixorn/awesome-zsh-plugins/week/README.md)

### [zsh-mgr](https://github.com/amt911/zsh-mgr)

*   Auto-updates all plugins.
*   Auto-updates itself.
*   Configurable time interval for both auto-updaters.

### Plugins / [superconsole](https://github.com/alexchmykhalo/superconsole) - Windows-only

*   [git-switch-branch-skim (‚≠ê0)](https://github.com/okhiroyuki/zsh-git-switch-branch-skim) - Allows you to switch `git` branches with [skim (‚≠ê5.4k)](https://github.com/lotabout/skim)
*   [select-history-skim (‚≠ê0)](https://github.com/okhiroyuki/zsh-select-history-skim) Rummage through your history with [skim (‚≠ê5.4k)](https://github.com/lotabout/skim).
*   [tinted-shell (‚≠ê68)](https://github.com/tinted-theming/tinted-shell) - Adds a script to allow you to change your shell's default ANSI colors but most importantly, colors 17 to 21 of your shell's 256 colorspace (if supported by your terminal). This script makes it possible to honor the original bright colors of your shell (e.g. bright green is still green and so on) while providing additional base16 colors to applications such as [Vim](https://www.vim.org).

### Themes / [superconsole](https://github.com/alexchmykhalo/superconsole) - Windows-only

*   [bahman (‚≠ê1)](https://github.com/bahmanworld/bahman-zsh-theme) - Requires Nerd Font. Has `git` status decorator.
*   [bigshrimp (‚≠ê1)](https://github.com/taksyon/BigShrimp-zsh-theme) - A clear and concise theme that includes decorators for username\@host, current directory and `git` status.
