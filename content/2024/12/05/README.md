*   [What is Answer Set Programming?](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-030-24658-7.pdf) - ***Springer***, 2008. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3691841207891991771)]. \[[Tutorial on AAAI](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.5555/1620270.1620340)]. Answer set programming (ASP) is a form of declarative programming oriented towards difficult search problems. As an outgrowth of research on the use of nonmonotonic reasoning in knowledge representation, it is particularly useful in knowledge-intensive applications. ASP programs consist of rules that look like Prolog rules, but the computational mechanisms used in ASP are different: they are based on the ideas that have led to the creation of fast satisfiability solvers for propositional logic.
