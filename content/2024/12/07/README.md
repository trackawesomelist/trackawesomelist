### Domain Specific Language / Logic DSL Applications

*   [Qualitative Simulation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0004370286900731) - ***Artificial Intelligence***, 1986. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4945009733425184345\&hl=en\&as_sdt=0,5)]. \[[Preprint](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/ftp/qsim/papers/Kuipers-aij-86.pdf)]. This paper presents a precise definition of qualitative structure and behavior descriptions as abstractions of differential equations and continuously differentiable functions. The authors present a new algorithm for qualitative simulation that generalizes the best features of existing algorithms, and allows direct comparisons among alternate approaches. Starting with a set of constraints abstracted from a differential equation, this work proves that the QSIM algorithm is guaranteed to produce a qualitative behavior corresponding to any solution to the original equation. The paper also shows that any qualitative simulation algorithm will sometimes produce spurious qualitative behaviors: ones which do not correspond to any mechanism satisfying the given constraints. These observations suggest specific types of care that must be taken in designing applications of qualitative causal reasoning systems, and in constructing and validating a knowledge base of mechanism descriptions.
