## [1. Awesome Agi Cocosci](/content/YuzheSHI/awesome-agi-cocosci/README.md)

### Domain Specific Language / Design Theory

*   [Usability Evaluation of Domain-Specific Languages](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6511840) - ***ICQICT'12***, 2012. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3047215455890195199)]. \[[Preprint](http://www-ctp.di.fct.unl.pt/QUASAR/Resources/Papers/2012/Barisic2012SEDES.pdf)]. The purpose of this proposal is to contribute to the systematic activity of Software Language Engineering by focusing on the issue of the Usability evaluation of DSLs. Usability evaluation is often skipped, relaxed, or at least omitted from papers reporting development of DSLs. The authors argue that a systematic approach based on User Interface experimental validation techniques should be used to assess the impact of new DSLs. For that purpose, the authors propose to merge common Usability evaluation processes with the DSL development process.
