## [9. Awesome Agi Cocosci](/content/YuzheSHI/awesome-agi-cocosci/week/README.md)

### Abduction / Applications in AI

*   [Abductive Logic Programming](https://academic.oup.com/logcom/article-abstract/2/6/719/942121) - ***Journal of Logic Computation***, 1992. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=18119357517656745518)]. This paper is a survey and critical overview of recent work on the extension of logic programming to perform abductive reasoning (abductive logic programming). The authors outline the general framework of abduction and its applications to knowledge assimilation and default reasoning; and they introduce an argumentation-theoretic approach to the use of abduction as an interpretation for negation as failure.
*   [Bayesian Abductive Logic Programs: A Probabilistic Logic for Abductive Reasoning](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.5555/2283696.2283887) - ***IJCAI'11***, 2011. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4453424083730209198)]. \[[Preprint](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~ml/papers/raghavan.starai10.pdf)]. This work introduces Bayesian Abductive Logic Programs (BALP), a probabilistic logic that adapts Bayesian Logic Programs (BLPs) for abductive reasoning. Like BLPs, BALPs also combine first-order logic and Bayes nets. However, unlike BLPs, which use deduction to construct Bayes nets, BALPs employ logical abduction. As a result, BALPs are more suited for problems like plan/activity recognition that require abductive reasoning.

### Bayesian Modeling / Bayesian Induction

*   [Probabilistic machine learning and artificial intelligence](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14541) - ***Nature***, 2015. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1783282361269717744)]. Probabilistic modelling provides a framework for understanding what learning is, and has therefore emerged as one of the principal theoretical and practical approaches for designing machines that learn from data acquired through experience. The probabilistic framework, which describes how to represent and manipulate uncertainty about models and predictions, has a central role in scientific data analysis, machine learning, robotics, cognitive science and artificial intelligence. This Review provides an introduction to this framework, and discusses some of the state-of-the-art advances in the field, namely, probabilistic programming, Bayesian optimization, data compression and automatic model discovery.
*   [Generalization, similarity, and Bayesian inference](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/generalization-similarity-and-bayesian-inference/595CAA321C9C56270C624057021DE77A) - ***Behavioral and Brain Sciences***, 2001. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14074987155133342565)]. \[[Preprint](http://web.mit.edu/cocosci/archive/Papers/tenenbaum_griffiths01.pdf)]. Shepard has argued that a universal law should govern generalization across different domains of perception and cognition, as well as across organisms from different species or even different planets. Starting with some basic assumptions about natural kinds, he derived an exponential decay function as the form of the universal generalization gradient, which accords strikingly well with a wide range of empirical data. However, his original formulation applied only to the ideal case of generalization from a single encountered stimulus to a single novel stimulus, and for stimuli that can be represented as points in a continuous metric psychological space. The authors recast Shepard's theory in a more general Bayesian framework and show how this naturally extends his approach to the more realistic situation of generalizing from multiple consequential stimuli with arbitrary representational structure. This framework also subsumes a version of Tversky's set-theoretic model of similarity, which is conventionally thought of as the primary alternative to Shepard's continuous metric space model of similarity and generalization.

### Communications / Language Compositionality

*   [Language is primarily a tool for communication rather than thought](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07522-w) - ***Nature***, 2024. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13724799649075764503)]. This perspective brings recent evidence from neuroscience and allied disciplines to argue that in modern humans, language is a tool for communication, contrary to a prominent view that we use language for thinking. The authors begins by introducing the brain network that supports linguistic ability in humans. They then review evidence for a double dissociation between language and thought, and discuss several properties of language that suggest that it is optimized for communication. This perspective concludes that although the emergence of language has unquestionably transformed human culture, language does not appear to be a prerequisite for complex thought, including symbolic thought. Instead, language is a powerful tool for the transmission of cultural knowledge; it plausibly co-evolved with humans' thinking and reasoning capacities, and only reflects, rather than gives rise to, the signature sophistication of human cognition.

### Domain Specific Language / Declarative DSL Applications

*   [The Scene Language: Representing Scenes with Programs, Words, and Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16770) - 2024. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=8704845413716059914)]. \[[Project](https://ai.stanford.edu/~yzzhang/projects/scene-language/)]. This paper introduces the Scene Language, a visual scene representation that concisely and precisely describes the structure, semantics, and identity of visual scenes. It represents a scene with three key components: a program that specifies the hierarchical and relational structure of entities in the scene, words in natural language that summarize the semantic class of each entity, and embeddings that capture the visual identity of each entity. This representation can be inferred from pre-trained language models via a training-free inference technique, given text or image inputs.

### Methodologies for Experiments / Virtual Reality

*   [What's the Game, then? Opportunities and Challenges for Runtime Behavior Generation](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3654777.3676358) - ***UIST'24***, 2024. \[[All Versions](https://github.com/SHI-Yu-Zhe/awesome-agi-cocosci/blob/master/README.md/)]. Procedural content generation (PCG), the process of algorithmically creating game components instead of manually, has been a common tool of game development for decades. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) enable the generation of game behaviors based on player input at runtime. Such code generation brings with it the possibility of entirely new gameplay interactions that may be difficult to integrate with typical game development workflows. This work explores these implications through GROMIT, a novel LLM-based runtime behavior generation system for Unity. When triggered by a player action, GROMIT generates a relevant behavior which is compiled without developer intervention and incorporated into the game.
