## [15. Awesome Agi Cocosci](/content/YuzheSHI/awesome-agi-cocosci/week/README.md)

### Domain Specific Language / Design Theory

*   [Domain Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_engineering) - ***Wikipedia***. Wikipedia encyclopedia entry on Domain Engineering.

### Domain Specific Language / Design Practises

*   [Quantifying usability of domain-specific languages: An empirical study on software maintenance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121214002799) - ***Journal of Systems and Software***, 2015. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3450893039446010260)]. A DSL aims to support software development by offering abstractions to a particular domain. It is expected that DSLs improve the maintainability of artifacts otherwise produced with general-purpose languages. However, the maintainability of the DSL artifacts and, hence, their adoption in mainstream development, is largely dependent on the usability of the language itself. Unfortunately, it is often hard to identify their usability strengths and weaknesses early, as there is no guidance on how to objectively reveal them. Usability is a multi-faceted quality characteristic, which is challenging to quantify beforehand by DSL stakeholders. There is even less support on how to quantitatively evaluate the usability of DSLs used in maintenance tasks. In this context, this paper reports a study to compare the usability of textual DSLs under the perspective of software maintenance. A usability measurement framework was developed based on the cognitive dimensions of notations. The framework was evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively using two DSLs in the context of two evolving object-oriented systems. The results suggested that the proposed metrics were useful: (1) to early identify DSL usability limitations, (2) to reveal specific DSL features favoring maintenance tasks, and (3) to successfully analyze eight critical DSL usability dimensions.

### Domain Specific Language / Declarative DSL Applications

*   [iContractML 2.0: A domain-specific language for modeling and deploying smart contracts onto multiple blockchain platforms](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950584921002081) - ***Information and Software Technology***, 2022. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1548144959305241494)]. Smart contracts play a vital role in many fields. Despite being called smart, the development of smart contracts is a tedious task beyond defining a set of contractual rules. In addition to business knowledge, coding a smart contract requires strong technical knowledge in a multiplex of new and rapidly changing domain-specific languages and blockchain platforms. The goal of this paper is to assist developers in building smart contracts independently from the language or the target blockchain platform. In which, this paper presents the second-generation smart contract language iContractML 2.0. iContractML 2.0 is an extensible framework that empowers developers to model and generate functional smart contract code that can be deployed onto multiple blockchain platforms.
