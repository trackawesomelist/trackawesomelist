## [22. Awesome Agi Cocosci](/content/YuzheSHI/awesome-agi-cocosci/week/README.md)

### Abduction / Applications in AI

*   [Abduction in Logic Programming](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-45628-7_16) - ***Computational Logic***, 2002. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=902643678163312237)]. \[[Preprint](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs227/Readings/Abudction%20in%20LP.pdf)]. Abduction in Logic Programming started in the late 80s, early 90s, in an attempt to extend logic programming into a framework suitable for a variety of problems in Artificial Intelligence and other areas of Computer Science. This paper aims to chart out the main developments of the field over the last ten years and to take a critical view of these developments from several perspectives: logical, epistemological, computational and suitability to application. The paper attempts to expose some of the challenges and prospects for the further development of the field.

### Concepts / Human Concept Representation

*   [Why concepts are (probably) vectors](https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/abstract/S1364-6613\(24\)00171-2) - ***Trends in Cognitive Sciences***, 2024. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4315363807034184312)]. For decades, cognitive scientists have debated what kind of representation might characterize human concepts. Whatever the format of the representation, it must allow for the computation of varied properties, including similarities, features, categories, definitions, and relations. It must also support the development of theories, ad hoc categories, and knowledge of procedures. Here, the authors discuss why vector-based representations provide a compelling account that can meet all these needs while being plausibly encoded into neural architectures. This view has become especially promising with recent advances in both large language models and vector symbolic architectures. These innovations show how vectors can handle many properties traditionally thought to be out of reach for neural models, including compositionality, definitions, structures, and symbolic computational processes.

### Domain Specific Language / Cognitive Foundations

*   [The Child as Hacker](https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613\(20\)30174-1) - ***Trends in Cognitive Sciences***, 2020. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13128656954836679743)]. The scope of human learning and development poses a radical challenge for cognitive science. The authors propose that developmental theories can address this challenge by adopting perspectives from computer science. Many of our best models treat learning as analogous to computer programming because symbolic programs provide the most compelling account of sophisticated mental representations. The authors specifically propose that children‚Äôs learning is analogous to a particular style of programming called hacking, making code better along many dimensions through an open-ended set of goals and activities. By contrast to existing theories, which depend primarily on local search and simple metrics, this view highlights the many features of good mental representations and the multiple complementary processes children use to create them.
