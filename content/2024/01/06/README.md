## [1. Awesome Agi Cocosci](/content/YuzheSHI/awesome-agi-cocosci/README.md)

### Domain Specific Language / Design Theory

*   [Design Guidelines for Domain Specific Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.2378) - ***OOPSLA Workshop on Domain-Specific Modeling (DSM' 09)***, 2009. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1962567819031018744)]. Designing a new domain specific language is as any other complex task sometimes error-prone and usually time consuming, especially if the language shall be of high-quality and comfortably usable. Existing tool support focuses on the simplification of technical aspects but lacks support for an enforcement of principles for a good language design. In this paper we investigate guidelines that are useful for designing domain specific languages, largely based on our experience in developing languages as well as relying on existing guidelines on general purpose (GPLs) and modeling languages. This work defined Guidelines to support a DSL developer to achieve better quality of the language design and a better acceptance among its users.
