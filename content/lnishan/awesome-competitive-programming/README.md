  Platform: CLI / Cross-Platform

  Description: Emacs is another popular text editor (or development environment to be more precise). The debate on "Vim vs. Emacs" is constantly brought up due to their popularity. Basically Emacs is more than just a text editor. It has plugins like file managers, web browsers, mail clients and news clients that allows users to performs these tasks directly inside Emacs. Emacs is "heavier" because of this, but it arguably has a relatively easier learning curve for beginners.

- ☆: ★★☆

  Name: [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)

  Platform: GUI / Cross-Platform

You may want to turn off its code inspection feature as it will cause quite a bit of lag.


- ☆: ★☆☆

  Name: Other IDEs

  Platform: Mixed

  Description: [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) is the IDE to use in case you want to code in C#. ... Both [Atom](https://atom.io/) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) are built with Electron (written in JavaScript) and therefore somewhat resource-hogging. ...
