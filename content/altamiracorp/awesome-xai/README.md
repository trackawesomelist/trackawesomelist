### Papers / Landmarks

*   [Explanation in Artificial Intelligence: Insights from the Social Sciences](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.07269) - This paper provides an introduction to the social science research into explanations. The author provides 4 major findings: (1) explanations are constrastive, (2) explanations are selected, (3) probabilities probably don't matter, (4) explanations are social. These fit into the general theme that explanations are -contextual-.
*   [Sanity Checks for Saliency Maps](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03292) - An important read for anyone using saliency maps. This paper proposes two experiments to determine whether saliency maps are useful: (1) model parameter randomization test compares maps from trained and untrained models, (2) data randomization test compares maps from models trained on the original dataset and models trained on the same dataset with randomized labels. They find that "some widely deployed saliency methods are independent of both the data the model was trained on, and the model parameters".

### Papers / Critiques

*   [Attention is not Explanation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10186) - Authors perform a series of NLP experiments which argue attention does not provide meaningful explanations. They also demosntrate that different attentions can generate similar model outputs.
*   [Attention is not --not-- Explanation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.04626) - This is a rebutal to the above paper. Authors argue that multiple explanations can be valid and that the and that attention can produce *a* valid explanation, if not -the- valid explanation.
*   [Do Not Trust Additive Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.11420) - Authors argue that addditive explanations (e.g. LIME, SHAP, Break Down) fail to take feature ineractions into account and are thus unreliable.
*   [Please Stop Permuting Features An Explanation and Alternatives](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.03151) - Authors demonstrate why permuting features is misleading, especially where there is strong feature dependence. They offer several previously described alternatives.
*   [Stop Explaining Black Box Machine Learning Models for High States Decisions and Use Interpretable Models Instead](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-019-0048-x?fbclid=IwAR3156gP-ntoAyw2sHTXo0Z8H9p-2wBKe5jqitsMCdft7xA0P766QvSthFs) - Authors present a number of issues with explainable ML and challenges to interpretable ML: (1) constructing optimal logical models, (2) constructing optimal sparse scoring systems, (3) defining interpretability and creating methods for specific methods. They also offer an argument for why interpretable models might exist in many different domains.
*   [The (Un)reliability of Saliency Methods](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-28954-6_14) - Authors demonstrate how saliency methods vary attribution when adding a constant shift to the input data. They argue that methods should fulfill *input invariance*, that a saliency method mirror the sensistivity of the model with respect to transformations of the input.
