    The tool is a fork of `gofmt` as of Go 1.19, and requires Go 1.18 or later.  It can be used as a drop-in replacement to format your Go code, and running gofmt  after gofumpt should produce no changes.
    `gofumpt` will never add rules which disagree with `gofmt` formatting. So we extend `gofmt` rather than compete with it.

*   [dialyzer](https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/dialyzer.html) — The DIALYZER, a DIscrepancy AnaLYZer for ERlang programs. Dialyzer is a static analysis tool that identifies software discrepancies,  such as definite type errors, code that has become dead or unreachable  because of programming error, and unnecessary tests,  in single Erlang modules or entire (sets of) applications.
    Dialyzer starts its analysis from either debug-compiled BEAM bytecode  or from Erlang source code. The file and line number of a discrepancy  is reported along with an indication of what the discrepancy is about.  Dialyzer bases its analysis on the concept of success typings,  which allows for sound warnings (no false positives).
