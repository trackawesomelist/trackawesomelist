- Quote: ‚ÄúMeasuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring aircraft building progress by weight.‚Äù <br><br> ‚ÄúThe advance of technology is based on making it fit in so that you don't really even notice it, so it's part of everyday life.‚Äù <br><br> "Success today requires the agility and drive to constantly rethink, reinvigorate, react, and reinvent" <br><br> ‚ÄúThe Internet is becoming the town square for the global village of tomorrow.‚Äù <br><br> ‚ÄùYour most unhappy customers are your greatest source of learning.‚Äù <br><br> ‚ÄùThe best way to prepare \[to be a programmer] is to write programs, and to study great programs that other people have written. In my case, I went to the garbage cans at the Computer Science Center and fished out listings of their operating system.‚Äù
