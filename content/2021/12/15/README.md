## [4. Awesome Terraform](/content/shuaibiyy/awesome-terraform/README.md)

### Tools / Community providers

*   [driftctl (⭐2.5k)](https://github.com/snyk/driftctl) - Detect, track, and alert on infrastructure drift :skull:

## [5. Alternative Internet](/content/redecentralize/alternative-internet/README.md)

### Developer tools and frameworks

*   [OrbitDB (⭐8.3k)](https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit-db) is a serverless, distributed, peer-to-peer database. OrbitDB uses IPFS as its data storage and IPFS Pubsub to automatically sync databases with peers. It's an eventually consistent database that uses CRDTs for conflict-free database merges making OrbitDB an excellent choice for decentralized apps (dApps), blockchain applications and offline-first web applications.
*   [RenderJS](http://www.renderjs.org) is a JavaScript library which provides an easy way to define gadgets (aka mashups) in pure HTML5, without requiring any application server. It is suitable for the development of mobile applications, desktop applications.

### Networking

*   [Project Meshnet](https://projectmeshnet.org/) aims to build a sustainable decentralized alternative internet. Used by [Hyperboria](http://hyperboria.net/) and built on [CJDNS](http://cjdns.info/).

### Uncategorised

*   [cjdns (⭐5.2k)](https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns) - Encrypted networking for regular people. cjdns implements an encrypted IPv6 network using public key cryptography for address allocation and a distributed hash table for routing. This provides near zero-configuration networking without many of the security and robustness issues that regular IPv4 and IPv6 networks have.

### Dead

*   [Telehash](http://telehash.org/) a new encrypted P2P JSON-based protocol enabling developers to quickly build apps that are distributed and private (see the [protocol (⭐483)](https://github.com/telehash/telehash.org/blob/master/protocol.md) spec)

## [6. Awesome Kotlin](/content/KotlinBy/awesome-kotlin/README.md)

### Libraries/Frameworks / Testing

*   [xgouchet/Elmyr (⭐83)](https://github.com/xgouchet/Elmyr) - A utility to make Kotlin/Java tests random yet reproducible

## [7. Awesome Ios](/content/vsouza/awesome-ios/README.md)

### Deployment / Distribution

*   [Runway](https://runway.team) - Easier mobile releases for teams. Integrates across tools (version control, project management, CI, app stores, crash reporting, etc.) to provide a single source of truth for mobile teams to come together around during release cycles. Equal parts automation and collaboration.

## [8. Awesome Scientific Computing](/content/nschloe/awesome-scientific-computing/README.md)
