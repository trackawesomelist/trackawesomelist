## [63. Awesome Board Games](/content/edm00se/awesome-board-games/week/README.md)

### Party

### [Love Letter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Letter_\(card_game\))

> Love Letter is a game of risk, deduction, and luck. Each player attempts to have their love letter delivered to Annette, the princess of Tempest, before anyone else does. From a deck with sixteen cards and eight roles, each player starts with one card. As the game progresses, each player must choose between their current role and those remaining in the deck. Will your letter reach the princess first?

![Love Letter Image](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/itemrep/img/x7Xa_F99E1UJXXKp2_NQi-sgwEM=/fit-in/246x300/pic1401448.jpg)

| Players | Min. Age | Time |
| ------: | -------: | ---: |
|   2 - 4 |       10 |  20m |
### [TZAAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TZAAR)

> TZAAR is the second game in the GIPF series of abstract strategy games. Each player has types of pieces (6 tzaars, 9 tzarras, and 15 totts). Players take turns trying to capture opponent's pieces or stacking their pieces. Stacking pieces makes them stronger but reduces the number of pieces the player has on the board. Players lose if they cannot capture their opponent's piece or they do not have at least one type of each piece on the board.

![TZAAR image](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/83RmBw8qTkDJo7qC-YY8og__itemrep/img/MsIQXw5i3XfQPNqcsKM56bPS-So=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\(\)/pic3607816.jpg)

| Players | Min. Age |   Time |
| ------: | -------: | -----: |
|       2 |       13 | 30-60m |
### [Pinch 'n' Pass](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/270030/pinch-n-pass)

> Battle with your opponents and the buzzer in this quick-thinking, fast-paced game of categories. How many famous actors, pizza topping, things that are red, or breeds of dog can you name under pressure? ‚ÄòPinch‚Äô and ‚Äòpass‚Äô category cards differ in that you try to snag pinch cards from other players by shouting out something from the category and you try to get rid of pass cards hot-potato style by saying something from the category. Whoever‚Äôs left holding the card when the buzzer goes off reaps the benefit (for pinch cards) or suffering the penalty (for pass cards). First player to the finish line is the winner, but don‚Äôt get knocked out for getting caught with too many pass cards! Each player may also call another player out for a head-to-head round. You can only do it once, so make it count!
