### The Code / Tools

*   [linux/include/linux/bpf.h](https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/include/linux/bpf.h) - with [linux/include/uapi/bpf.h](https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/include/uapi/linux/bpf.h): definitions related to eBPF, to be used respectively in the kernel and to interface with userspace programs.
*   [linux/include/linux/filter.h](https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/include/linux/filter.h) - with [linux/include/uapi/filter.h](https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/include/uapi/linux/filter.h): information used to run the BPF programs themselves.
*   [linux/kernel/bpf/](https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/kernel/bpf) - This directory contains most of BPF-related code. In particular, those files are worth of interest:

    *   [`syscall.c`](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/kernel/bpf/syscall.c) - Different operations permitted by the system call, such as program loading or map management.
    *   [`core.c`](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/kernel/bpf/core.c) - BPF interpreter.
    *   [`verifier.c`](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/kernel/bpf/verifier.c) - BPF verifier.
*   [linux/net/core/filter.c](https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/net/core/filter.c) - Functions and eBPF helpers related to networking (TC, XDP etc.); also contains the code to migrate cBPF bytecode to eBPF (all cBPF programs are translated to eBPF in recent kernels).
*   [linux/kernel/trace/bpf\_trace.c](https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/kernel/trace/bpf_trace.c) - Functions and eBPF helpers related to tracing and monitoring (kprobes, tracepoints, etc.).
*   The JIT compilers are under the directory of their respective architectures, such as file [linux/arch/x86/net/bpf\_jit\_comp.c](https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/arch/x86/net/bpf_jit_comp.c) for x86. Exception is made for JIT compilers used for hardware offload, sitting in their drivers, such as [linux/drivers/net/ethernet/netronome/nfp/bpf/jit.c](https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/net/ethernet/netronome/nfp/bpf/jit.c) for Netronome NFP.
*   [linux/net/sched/](https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/net/sched) - and in particular in files `act_bpf.c` (action) and `cls_bpf.c` (filter): code related to BPF actions and filters with TC.
*   [linux/kernel/seccomp.c](https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/kernel/seccomp.c)
*   [linux/net/core/dev.c](https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/net/core/dev.c) - contains the function `dev_change_xdp_fd()` that is called through a Netlink command to hook a XDP program to a device, after is has been loaded into the kernel from user space. This function in turns uses a callback from the relevant driver.
