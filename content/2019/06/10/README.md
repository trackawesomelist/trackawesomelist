### Quotes

- Quote: ‚ÄúMost good programmers do programming not because they expect to get paid or get adulation by the public, but because it is fun to program.‚Äù <br><br> ‚ÄúSoftware is like sex; it's better when it's free.‚Äù <br><br> ‚ÄúArtists usually don't make all that much money, and they often keep their artistic hobby despite the money rather than due to it.‚Äù <br><br> ‚ÄúI often compare open source to science. To where science took this whole notion of developing ideas in the open and improving on other peoples' ideas and making it into what science is today and the incredible advances that we have had. And I compare that to witchcraft and alchemy, where openness was something you didn't do.‚Äù <br><br> ‚ÄúTalk is cheap. Show me the code.‚Äù <br><br> "Don't hurry your code. Make sure it works well and is well designed. Don't worry about timing" <br><br> "Programmers are in the enviable position of not only getting to do what they want to, but because the end result is so important they get paid to do it. There are other professions like that, but not that many" <br><br> "In many cases the user interface to a program is the most important part for a commercial company: whether the programs works correctly or not seems to be secondary"
