### Other scripting utilities / Third-party APIs

*   [WCL (⭐68)](https://github.com/wadehennessey/wcl) \[stalled] - allow hundreds of Lisp
    applications to be realistically available at once, while allowing

    providing Common Lisp as a Unix shared library that can be linked with
    Lisp and C code to produce efficient applications.  For example, the
    executable for a Lisp version of the canonical `Hello World!`
    program requires only 20k bytes on 32 bit x86 Linux.  WCL also
    supports a full development environment, including dynamic file
    loading and debugging.  A modified version of GDB is used to debug WCL
    programs, providing support for mixed language debugging.
