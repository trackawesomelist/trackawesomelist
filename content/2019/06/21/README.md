## [1. Awesome Cl](/content/CodyReichert/awesome-cl/README.md)

### Natural Language Processing

*   [babel2 (‚≠ê7)](https://github.com/lucas8/Babel2/) - A Fluid Construction Grammar implementation, computational framework, and unification-based grammar formalism [Apache2.0](https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/License:Apache2.0).

### Other scripting utilities / Third-party APIs

*   [WCL (‚≠ê79)](https://github.com/wadehennessey/wcl) \[stalled] - allow hundreds of Lisp
    applications to be realistically available at once, while allowing
    several of them to run concurrently.  WCL accomplishes this by
    providing Common Lisp as a Unix shared library that can be linked with
    Lisp and C code to produce efficient applications.  For example, the
    executable for a Lisp version of the canonical `Hello World!`
    program requires only 20k bytes on 32 bit x86 Linux.  WCL also
    supports a full development environment, including dynamic file
    loading and debugging.  A modified version of GDB is used to debug WCL
    programs, providing support for mixed language debugging.
    *   a [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/141478.141560): "Delivering efficient Common Lisp applications under Unix".
