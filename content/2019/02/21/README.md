### Cross-platform Shell Reference / Utility Packs

*   Use `&&` to run commands in sequence. If a command fails, the script exits.
*   Use `|` to pipe the stdout of one command into the stdin of the next. (`do-something | something else`)
*   Use `>` to write the stdout of a command to a file. (`do-something > file`)
*   Use `<` to send the contents of a file to a command's stdin. (`command < file`)
*   Use `cd <dir>` to change the current working directory to `<dir>`. Note that `cd` alone prints the current working directory on windows, but changes the working directory to `~` on \*nix.
