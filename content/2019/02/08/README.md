Event Engine - a very powerful system for producing Multi-Threaded, Asynchronous and Event-Driven programs. Generics Collections - highly efficient Collection Types (Lists, Trees, Maps etc.). Math Library - a library for Unit Conversion, special calculation and other useful mathematics routines. Package Engine - extension of the Streamables Engine supporting the packaging of files together (a VFS of sorts). Shared Streams Library - 100% Thread-Safe Stream Classes (Interfaced too) allowing read/write from multiple Threads. Stream Handling Library - makes working with Streams much easier! Handles Deleting, Inserting, Reading and Writing data.
*   [Redux Delphi (⭐38)](https://github.com/pierrejean-coudert/ReduxDelphi). `[Delphi]` Predictable state container for Delphi apps utilizing a unidirectional data flow. Inspired by ReduxJS. Comes with Immutable Generic List.
*   [unRxLib](http://www.micrel.cz/RxLib/dfiles.htm). `[Delphi]` Effort to keep RxLibrary (library of 60+ components) actual.

### Video

*   [DSPack](https://code.google.com/p/dspack) (abandoned, active fork is [here (⭐20)](https://github.com/micha137/dspack-continued-mirror-for-delphinus)). `[Delphi]` Set of components and classes to write Multimedia Applications using MS Direct Show and DirectX technologies.

### Graphic

*   [GraphicEx (⭐96)](https://github.com/mike-lischke/GraphicEx). `[Delphi]` Addendum to Delphi's Graphics.pas to enable your application to load many common image formats. This library is primarily designed to load images as background (buttons, forms, toolbars) and textures (DirectX, OpenGL) or for image browsing and editing purposes as long as you don't need to save images.
*   [CCR-EXIF](https://code.google.com/p/ccr-exif) (seems abandoned, list of forks on GH [here](https://github.com/search?l=Pascal\&o=desc\&q=ccr-exif\&s=updated\&type=Repositories)). `[Delphi]` Library to read and write Exif, IPTC and XMP metadata from JPEG, TIFF and PSD images.
*   [Synopse PDF (⭐245)](https://github.com/synopse/SynPDF). `[Delphi]` `[FPC]` Fully featured Open Source PDF document creation library for Delphi, embedded in one unit. Pure Delphi code, Delphi 5 up to Delphi 10.3 Rio (and latest version of FPC), for Win32 and Win64 platforms.
*   [IGDI+](https://sourceforge.net/projects/igdiplus). `[Delphi]` The free open source library allows quick and easy implementations of complex GDI+ applications, in a natural Delphi-friendly code.
*   [GLScene](https://sourceforge.net/projects/glscene). `[Delphi]` `[FPC]` OpenGL based 3D library for Delphi, C++Builder and Lazarus. It provides visual components and objects allowing description and rendering of 3D scenes in an easy, no-hassle, yet powerful manner. GLScene is not just an OpenGL wrapper or utility library, it has grown to become a set of founding classes for a generic 3D engine with Rapid Application Development in mind. GLScene allows you to quickly design and render 3D scenes without having to learn the intricacies of OpenGL, if you know how to design a TForm, you'll easily master the basic operations of GLScene. The library comes with a large collections of demos showcasing the ease of use, and demonstrating RAD wasn't done at the expense of CPU/GPU horsepower.
*   [SynGdiPlus (⭐742)](https://github.com/synopse/mORMot/blob/master/SynGdiPlus.pas). `[Delphi]` `[FPC]` Enables an application to load and save GIF, TIF, PNG and JPG pictures.
