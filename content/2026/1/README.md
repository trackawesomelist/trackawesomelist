## [5. Awesome Agi Cocosci](/content/YuzheSHI/awesome-agi-cocosci/week/README.md)

### Domain Specific Language / DSL Program Synthesis

*   [Enhancing Robot Program Synthesis Through Environmental Context](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/hash/0c1e94af650f5c74b1f3da467c2308c2-Abstract-Conference.html) - ***NeurIPS'23***, 2023. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17630134586050451683)]. Program synthesis aims to automatically generate an executable program that conforms to the given specification. Recent advancements have demonstrated that deep neural methodologies and large-scale pretrained language models are highly proficient in capturing program semantics. For robot programming, prior works have facilitated program synthesis by incorporating global environments. However, the assumption of acquiring a comprehensive understanding of the entire environment is often excessively challenging to achieve. This work presents a framework that learns to synthesize a program by rectifying potentially erroneous code segments, with the aid of partially observed environments. To tackle the issue of inadequate attention to partial observations, the authors propose to first learn an environment embedding space that can implicitly evaluate the impacts of each program token based on the precondition. Furthermore, by employing a graph structure, the model can aggregate both environmental and syntactic information flow and furnish smooth program rectification guidance. Extensive experimental evaluations and ablation studies on the partially observed VizDoom domain authenticate that the method offers superior generalization capability across various tasks and greater robustness when encountering noises.
