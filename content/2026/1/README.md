### Domain Specific Language / DSL Program Synthesis

*   [Enhancing Robot Program Synthesis Through Environmental Context](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/hash/0c1e94af650f5c74b1f3da467c2308c2-Abstract-Conference.html) - ***NeurIPS'23***, 2023. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17630134586050451683)]. Program synthesis aims to automatically generate an executable program that conforms to the given specification. Recent advancements have demonstrated that deep neural methodologies and large-scale pretrained language models are highly proficient in capturing program semantics. For robot programming, prior works have facilitated program synthesis by incorporating global environments. However, the assumption of acquiring a comprehensive understanding of the entire environment is often excessively challenging to achieve. This work presents a framework that learns to synthesize a program by rectifying potentially erroneous code segments, with the aid of partially observed environments. To tackle the issue of inadequate attention to partial observations, the authors propose to first learn an environment embedding space that can implicitly evaluate the impacts of each program token based on the precondition. Furthermore, by employing a graph structure, the model can aggregate both environmental and syntactic information flow and furnish smooth program rectification guidance. Extensive experimental evaluations and ablation studies on the partially observed VizDoom domain authenticate that the method offers superior generalization capability across various tasks and greater robustness when encountering noises.
*   [On the Effectiveness of Large Language Models in Domain-Specific Code Generation](https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3697012) - ***ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology***, 2025. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9022735489715766344)]. Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have shown remarkable capabilities in code generation. Despite significant achievements, they rely on enormous training data to acquire a broad spectrum of open-domain knowledge. Besides, their evaluation revolves around open-domain benchmarks like HumanEval, which primarily consist of programming contests. Therefore, it is hard to fully characterize the intricacies and challenges associated with particular domains (e.g., Web, game, and math). This work conducts an in-depth study of the LLMs in domain-specific code generation. The results demonstrate that LLMs exhibit sub-optimal performance in generating domain-specific code, due to their limited proficiency in utilizing domain-specific libraries. The authors further observe that incorporating API knowledge as prompts can empower LLMs to generate more professional code. Based on these findings, the authors further investigate how to effectively incorporate API knowledge into the code generation process. The authors experiment with three strategies for incorporating domain knowledge, namely, external knowledge inquirer, chain-of-thought prompting, and chain-of-thought fine-tuning. The authors refer to these strategies as a new code generation approach called DomCoder. Experimental results show that all strategies of DomCoder improve the effectiveness of domain-specific code generation under certain settings.
