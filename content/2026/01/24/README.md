## [1. Awesome Claude Code](/content/hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code/README.md)

### Agent Skills 🤖 / General

*   [Everything Claude Code (⭐42k)](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code) by [Affaan Mustafa](https://github.com/affaan-m/) - Top-notch, well-written resources covering "just about everything" from core engineering domains. What's nice about this "everything-" store is most of the resources have significant standalone value and unlike some all-encompassing frameworks, although you can opt in to the author's own specific workflow patterns if you choose, the individual resources offer exemplary patterns in (just about) every Claude Code feature you can find (apologies to the Output Styles devotees).

## [2. Awesome Zsh Plugins](/content/unixorn/awesome-zsh-plugins/README.md)

### Plugins / [superconsole](https://github.com/alexchmykhalo/superconsole) - Windows-only

*   [git-wt (⭐0)](https://github.com/fingergohappy/git-wt) - A ZSH-native `git` worktree workflow plugin.
*   [opencode (⭐0)](https://github.com/verlihirsh/zsh-opencode-plugin) - Stop googling shell commands. Just describe what you want in plain English, press Tab, and get the exact command you need.

### Themes / [superconsole](https://github.com/alexchmykhalo/superconsole) - Windows-only

*   [lcars (⭐0)](https://github.com/lgulliver/lcars-zsh-theme) - A Star Trek: The Next Generation LCARS-inspired theme for Oh My Zsh with modern powerline-style segments and authentic color palette. Includes decorators for `git` status, time, path, os and battery charge level.
*   [quietline (⭐0)](https://github.com/qwreey/quietline) - A simple theme inspired by the headline theme. Includes decorators for `git` status, user\@host and current directory.

### ZSH Tools / [superconsole](https://github.com/alexchmykhalo/superconsole) - Windows-only

*   [rust-zsh-plugin-cli (⭐0)](https://github.com/johnstonskj/rust-zsh-plugin-cli) - This tool scaffolds Zsh plugins with best practices built-in, including function tracking for clean unloading, optional alias support, autoloaded functions, and CI/CD workflows for shellcheck and shellspec. Choose from minimal, simple, or complete templates to match your plugin's complexity.

## [3. Static Analysis](/content/analysis-tools-dev/static-analysis/README.md)

### Programming Languages / [Other](#other-1)
