## [2. Awesome Claude Code](/content/hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code/README.md)

### Workflows & Knowledge Guides 🧠 / Ralph Wiggum

*   [Ralph for Claude Code (⭐6.5k)](https://github.com/frankbria/ralph-claude-code) by [Frank Bria](https://github.com/frankbria) - An autonomous AI development framework that enables Claude Code to work iteratively on projects until completion. Features intelligent exit detection, rate limiting, circuit breaker patterns, and comprehensive safety guardrails to prevent infinite loops and API overuse. Built with Bash, integrated with tmux for live monitoring, and includes 75+ comprehensive tests.
*   [Ralph Wiggum Marketer (⭐620)](https://github.com/muratcankoylan/ralph-wiggum-marketer) by [Muratcan Koylan](https://github.com/muratcankoylan) - A Claude Code plugin that provides an autonomous AI copywriter,  integrating the Ralph loop with customized knowledge bases for market research agents. The agents do the research, Ralph writes the copy, you stay in bed. Whether or not you practice Ralph-Driven Development (RDD), I think these projects are interesting and creative explorations of general agentic patterns.
*   [ralph-orchestrator (⭐1.7k)](https://github.com/mikeyobrien/ralph-orchestrator) by [mikeyobrien](https://github.com/mikeyobrien) - Ralph Orchestrator implements the simple but effective "Ralph Wiggum" technique for autonomous task completion, continuously running an AI agent against a prompt file until the task is marked as complete or limits are reached. This implementation provides a robust, well-tested, and feature-complete orchestration system for AI-driven development. Also cited in the Anthropic Ralph plugin documentation.
*   [The Ralph Playbook (⭐737)](https://github.com/ClaytonFarr/ralph-playbook) by [Clayton Farr](https://github.com/ClaytonFarr) - A remarkably detailed and comprehensive guide to the Ralph Wiggum technique, featuring well-written theoretical commentary paired with practical guidelines and advice.
