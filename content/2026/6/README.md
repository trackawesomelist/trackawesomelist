### Communications / Coordination

*   [HLSMAC: A New StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge for High-Level Strategic Decision-Making](https://openreview.net/forum?id=b7VmJ4107q) - ***AAMAS'26***, 2026. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=11127617290205220978)]. Benchmarks are crucial for assessing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms. While StarCraft II-related environments have driven significant advances in MARL, existing benchmarks like SMAC focus primarily on micromanagement, limiting comprehensive evaluation of high-level strategic intelligence. To address this, this work introduces HLSMAC, a new cooperative MARL benchmark with 12 carefully designed StarCraft II scenarios based on classical stratagems from the *Thirty-Six Stratagems*. Each scenario corresponds to a specific stratagem and is designed to challenge agents with diverse strategic elements, including tactical maneuvering, timing coordination, and deception, thereby opening up avenues for evaluating high-level strategic decision-making capabilities. The authors also propose novel metrics across multiple dimensions beyond conventional win rate, such as ability utilization and advancement efficiency, to assess agents' overall performance within the HLSMAC environment. The authors conduct a large-scale evaluation of 21 state-of-the-art MARL algorithms and LLM-based agents, with additional multi-seed analysis for relatively better-performing methods. The results demonstrate that HLSMAC serves as a robust testbed for advancing multi-agent strategic decision-making.

### Domain Specific Language / Design Theory

*   [PLIERS: A Process that Integrates User-Centered Methods into Programming Language Design](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3452379) - ***ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction***, 2021. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14808918880141361248)]. Programming language design requires making many usability-related design decisions. However, existing HCI methods can be impractical to apply to programming languages: languages have high iteration costs, programmers require significant learning time, and user performance has high variance. To address these problems, the authors adapted both formative and summative HCI methods to make them more suitable for programming language design. The authors integrated these methods into a new process, PLIERS, for designing programming languages in a user-centered way. The authors assessed PLIERS by using it to design two new programming languages. Glacier extends Java to enable programmers to express immutability properties effectively and easily. Obsidian is a language for blockchains that includes verification of critical safety properties. Empirical studies showed that the PLIERS process resulted in languages that could be used effectively by many programmers and revealed additional opportunities for language improvement.

### Domain Specific Language / Declarative DSL Applications

*   [RoboGrammar: graph grammar for terrain-optimized robot design](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3414685.3417831) - ***ACM Transactions on Graphics***, 2020. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7042593841334771437)]. This work presents RoboGrammar, a fully automated approach for generating optimized robot structures to traverse given terrains. This framework represents each robot design as a graph, and uses a graph grammar to express possible arrangements of physical robot assemblies. Each robot design can then be expressed as a sequence of grammar rules. Using only a small set of rules the grammar can describe hundreds of thousands of possible robot designs. The construction of the grammar limits the design space to designs that can be fabricated. For a given input terrain, the design space is searched to find the top performing robots and their corresponding controllers. The authors introduce Graph Heuristic Search - a novel method for efficient search of combinatorial design spaces. In Graph Heuristic Search, the authors explore the design space while simultaneously learning a function that maps incomplete designs (e.g., nodes in the combinatorial search tree) to the best performance values that can be achieved by expanding these incomplete designs. Graph Heuristic Search prioritizes exploration of the most promising branches of the design space. To test the method the authors optimize robots for a number of challenging and varied terrains. The authors demonstrate that RoboGrammar can successfully generate nontrivial robots that are optimized for a single terrain or a combination of terrains.

### Science Logology / AI Assisted Research

*   [Active learning accelerates electrolyte solvent screening for anode-free lithium metal batteries](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-63303-7) - ***Nature Communications***, 2025. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3974490115470252870)]. Anode-free or ‘zero-excess’ lithium metal batteries offer high energy density compared to current lithium-ion batteries but require electrolyte innovation to extend cycle life. Due to the lack of universal design principles, electrolyte development for anode-free lithium metal batteries is slow and incremental and mainly driven by trial-and-error. This work demonstrates the use of active learning as an alternative approach to accelerate electrolyte discovery for anode-free lithium metal batteries. Unlike conventional data-intensive frequentist machine learning techniques, the active learning framework employs sequential Bayesian experimental design with Bayesian model averaging to efficiently identify optimal candidates in typical data-scarce and noisy label settings. Using capacity retention in real Cu||LiFePO4 cells as the target property, the approach integrates experimental feedback to iteratively refine predictions. Starting with just 58 data points from an in-house cycling dataset, the active learning framework explored a virtual search space of 1 million electrolytes, rapidly converging on optimal candidates. After seven active learning campaigns with about ten electrolytes tested in each, four distinct electrolyte solvents are identified that rival state-of-the-art electrolytes in performance. This work showcases the promise of active learning approaches in navigating large electrolyte chemical spaces for next-generation batteries.
