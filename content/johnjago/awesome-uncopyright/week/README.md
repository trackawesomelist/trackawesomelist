*   Old images on [Pixabay](https://web.archive.org/web/20190108204845/https://pixabay.com/en/service/terms/) - **New images on Pixabay are [not in the public domain](https://opengameart.org/forumtopic/warning-pixabay-has-changed-the-license-not-compatible-with-cc-or-gpl-anymore)**, as they are released under the [Pixabay License](https://pixabay.com/service/license/) (among other things, [incompatible with the GPL](https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2019/01/13/pixabay-images-are-not-allowed/)). Pixabay switched to the new license [in 2019](https://pixabay.com/forum/official-pixabay-news-2/the-pixabay-license-7823/). Prior to that change, Pixabay used the [CC0 waiver](https://web.archive.org/web/20190108204845/https://pixabay.com/en/service/terms/). Therefore, old images are [still in the public domain](https://pixabay.com/it/forum/official-pixabay-news-2/the-pixabay-license-7823/?pagi=4), despite being [misleadingly tagged](https://pixabay.com/it/forum/official-pixabay-news-2/the-pixabay-license-7823/?pagi=4) with the Pixabay License. Before using an image, check what the state of the [terms of service](https://pixabay.com/service/) was at that point in time.

However, old images (from [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20150328140645/http://www.spacex.com/media) to [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20191122175115/https://www.spacex.com/media)) had indeed been placed into the public domain and have no copyright restriction (including some images on [Flickr](https://web.archive.org/web/20170412063800/https://www.flickr.com/photos/spacex/16787988882/)).
