### Domain Specific Language / Imperative DSL Applications

*   [Reproducibility in automated chemistry laboratories using computer science abstractions](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44160-024-00649-8) - ***Nature Synthesis***, 2024. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2583939834455194329)]. While abstraction is critical for the transferability of automated laboratory science in (bio)chemical and materials sciences, its improper implementation is a technical debt taken against the reproducibility of experimental results. Over the decades, computer science has developed guidelines and strategies for how abstractions are captured in programming languages---particularly concerning the substitutability of implementations of abstracted ideas and the clear definition of the contexts in which abstractions are used. However, few programming languages developed for automated experiments fully leverage the wisdom learned in computer science. To achieve collaborative sharing of scientific knowledge via automated laboratories, the way that experimental protocols are codified and interpreted by machine agents must use abstractions responsibly and with reproducibility, rather than solely transferability, at its core. This Review discusses how computer science principles of abstraction can be translated to create more reproducible automation as an enabler for the acceleration of collaborative research with self-driving laboratories.

### Domain Specific Language / Logic DSL Applications

*   [MoVer: Motion Verification for Motion Graphics Animations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13372) - 2025. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=527747131334466686)]. While large vision-language models can generate motion graphics animations from text prompts, they regularly fail to include all of spatio-temporal properties described in the prompt. This work introduces MoVer, a motion verification DSL based on first-order logic that can check spatio-temporal properties of a motion graphics animation. The authors identify a general set of such properties that people commonly use to describe animations (e.g., the direction and timing of motions, the relative positioning of objects, etc.). The authors implement these properties as predicates in MoVer and provide an execution engine that can apply a MoVer program to any input SVG-based motion graphics animation. The authors then demonstrate how MoVer can be used in an LLM-based synthesis and verification pipeline for iteratively refining motion graphics animations. Given a text prompt, the pipeline synthesizes a motion graphics animation and a corresponding MoVer program. Executing the verification program on the animation yields a report of the predicates that failed and the report can be automatically fed back to LLM to iteratively correct the animation.

### Abduction / Scientific Discovery

*   [Complexity Management in a Discovery Task](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/94n547fj) - ***CogSci'92***, 1992. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=18138712608977258974)]. Previous psychological research about scientific discovery has often focused on subjects' heuristics for discovering simple concepts with one relevant dimension or a few relevant dimensions with simple two-way interactions. This paper presents results from an experiment in which subjects had to discover a concept involving complex three-way interactions on a multi-valued output by running experiments in a computerized microworld. Twenty-two CMU undergraduates attempted the task, of which sixteen succeeded, in an average of 85 minutes. The analyses focus on three strategies used to regulate task complexity. First, subjects preferred depth-first to breadth-first search, with successful subjects regulating the number of features varied from experiment to experiment most effectively. Second, subjects systematically regulated the length of their experiments. Third, a new explicit search heuristic (Put Upon Stack Heuristic) used by successful subjects is described.

### Abduction / Rationalization

*   [Coalescing the Vapors of Human Experience into a Viable and Meaningful Comprehension](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/5f64z7d7) - ***CogSci'16***, 2016. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5460385008324352958)]. Models of concept learning and theory acquisition often invoke a stochastic search process, in which learners generate hypotheses through some structured random process and thenevaluate them on some data measuring their quality or value. To be successful within a reasonable time-frame, these models need ways of generating good candidate hypotheses evenbefore the data are considered. Schulz (2012a) has proposed that studying the origins of new ideas in more everyday contexts, such as how we think up new names for things, can provide insight into the cognitive processes that generate good hypotheses for learning. We propose a simple generative model for how people might draw on their experience to propose new names in everyday domains such as pub names or action movies, and show that it captures surprisingly well the names that people actually imagine. We discuss the role for an analogous hypothesis-generation mechanism in enabling and constraining causal theory learning.

### Abduction / Applications in AI

*   [Probabilistic Sufficient Explanations](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2021/0424.pdf) - ***IJCAI'21***, 2021. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1874102360688341104)]. Understanding the behavior of learned classifiers is an important task, and various black-box explanations, logical reasoning approaches, and model-specific methods have been proposed. This paper introduces probabilistic sufficient explanations, which formulate explaining an instance of classification as choosing the "simplest" subset of features such that only observing those features is "sufficient" to explain the classification. That is, sufficient to give us strong probabilistic guarantees that the model will behave similarly when all features are observed under the data distribution. In addition, the authors leverage tractable probabilistic reasoning tools such as probabilistic circuits and expected predictions to design a scalable algorithm for finding the desired explanations while keeping the guarantees intact. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in finding sufficient explanations, and showcase its advantages compared to Anchors and logical explanations.

### Abduction / Explanation

*   [A Grammar of Hypotheses for Visualization, Data, and Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.14267) - 2022. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=10321469321980973246)]. This work presents a grammar for expressing hypotheses in visual data analysis to formalize the previously abstract notion of "analysis tasks." Through the lens of this grammar, the authors lay the groundwork for how a user's data analysis questions can be operationalized and automated as a set of hypotheses (a hypothesis space). The authors demonstrate that the grammar-based approach for analysis tasks can provide a systematic method towards unifying three disparate spaces in visualization research: the hypotheses a dataset can express (a data hypothesis space), the hypotheses a user would like to refine or verify through analysis (an analysis hypothesis space), and the hypotheses a visualization design is capable of supporting (a visualization hypothesis space). The authors illustrate how the formalization of these three spaces can inform future research in visualization evaluation, knowledge elicitation, analytic provenance, and visualization recommendation by using a shared language for hypotheses. Finally, the authors compare the proposed grammar-based approach with existing visual analysis models and discuss the potential of a new hypothesis-driven theory of visual analytics.

### Concepts / AI Concept Representation

A preliminary work empirically showing that the intermediate embeddings of multilingual Transformers (1) start far away from output token embeddings; (2) already allow for decoding a semantically correct next token in the middle layers, but give higher probability to its version in English than in the input language; (3) finally move into an input-language-specific region of the embedding space. Also, the embedding of abstract concept space lies closer to English than to other languages.

### Concepts / AI Concept Representation

*   [From task structures to world models: what do LLMs know?](https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/abstract/S1364-6613\(24\)00035-4) - ***Trends in Cognitive Sciences***, 2024. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14836877410607949822)]. \[[Preprint](http://cncl.yale.edu/sites/default/files/pub-downloads/yildirim-paul-llms-knowledge.pdf)]. In what sense does a large language model (LLM) have knowledge? The authors answer by granting LLMs ‚Äòinstrumental knowledge‚Äô: knowledge gained by using next-word generation as an instrument. The authors then ask how instrumental knowledge is related to the ordinary, ‚Äòworldly knowledge‚Äô exhibited by humans, and explore this question in terms of the degree to which instrumental knowledge can be said to incorporate the structured world models of cognitive science. The authors discuss ways LLMs could recover degrees of worldly knowledge and suggest that such recovery will be governed by an implicit, resource-rational tradeoff between world models and tasks. The authors' answer to this question extends beyond the capabilities of a particular AI system and challenges assumptions about the nature of knowledge and intelligence.

### Concepts / Human Concept Representation

*   [Simple shape feature computation across modalities: convergence and divergence between the ventral and dorsal visual streams](https://academic.oup.com/cercor/article/33/15/9280/7190929) - ***Cerebral Cortex***, 2023. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5977822802446917081)]. \[[Preprints](http://bilab.bnu.edu.cn/paper/2023/Tian_2023_CC.pdf)]. Shape processing, whether by seeing or touching, is pivotal to object recognition and manipulation. Although the low-level signals are initially processed by different modality-specific neural circuits, multimodal responses to object shapes have been reported along both ventral and dorsal visual pathways. To understand this transitional process, the authors conducted visual and haptic shape perception fMRI experiments to test basic shape features (i.e. curvature and rectilinear) across the visual pathways. Using a combination of region-of-interest-based support vector machine decoding analysis and voxel selection method, the authors found that the top visual-discriminative voxels in the left occipital cortex (OC) could also classify haptic shape features, and the top haptic-discriminative voxels in the left posterior parietal cortex (PPC) could also classify visual shape features. Furthermore, these voxels could decode shape features in a cross-modal manner, suggesting shared neural computation across visual and haptic modalities. In the univariate analysis, the top haptic-discriminative voxels in the left PPC showed haptic rectilinear feature preference, whereas the top visual-discriminative voxels in the left OC showed no significant shape feature preference in either of the two modalities. Together, these results suggest that mid-level shape features are represented in a modality-independent manner in both the ventral and dorsal streams.

### Domain Specific Language / Design Theory

*   [Domain-Specific Modeling Languages: Requirements Analysis and Design Guidelines](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-36654-3_6) - ***Domain Engineering: Product Lines, Languages, and Conceptual Models***, 2013. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=15620404537599157753)]. In recent years, the development of domain-specific modeling languages has gained remarkable attention. This is for good reasons. A domain-specific modeling language incorporates concepts that represent domain-level knowledge. Hence, systems analysts are not forced to reconstruct these concepts from scratch. At the same time, domain-specific modeling languages contribute to model integrity, because they include already constraints that would otherwise have to be added manually. Even though there has been a considerable amount of research on developing and using domain-specific modeling languages, there is still lack of comprehensive methods to guide the design of these languages. With respect to the complexity and risk related to developing a domain-specific modeling language, this is a serious shortfall. This chapter is aimed at a contribution to filling the gap. At first, it presents guidelines for selecting a metamodeling language. Its main focus is on supporting the process from analyzing requirements to specifying and evaluating a domain-specific modeling language.

### Concepts / Human Concept Representation

*   [Navigating cognition: Spatial codes for human thinking](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.aat6766) - ***Science***, 2018. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1407237757770081862)]. \[[Preprint](https://doellerlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Bellmund_et_al_2018_Science_Navigating-cognition.pdf)]. The hippocampal formation has long been suggested to underlie both memory formation and spatial navigation. This work discusses how neural mechanisms identified in spatial navigation research operate across information domains to support a wide spectrum of cognitive functions. In the proposed framework, place and grid cell population codes provide a representational format to map variable dimensions of cognitive spaces. This highly dynamic mapping system enables rapid reorganization of codes through remapping between orthogonal representations across behavioral contexts, yielding a multitude of stable cognitive spaces at different resolutions and hierarchical levels. Action sequences result in trajectories through cognitive space, which can be simulated via sequential coding in the hippocampus. In this way, the spatial representational format of the hippocampal formation has the capacity to support flexible cognition and behavior.
*   [Structuring Knowledge with Cognitive Maps and Cognitive Graphs](https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613\(20\)30250-3) - ***Trends in Cognitive Sciences***, 2021. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7196012353183004425)]. \[[Preprint](https://www.sas.upenn.edu/psych/epsteinlab/pdfs/Peer%20Brunec%20Newcombe%20Epstein%20TiCS%202020%20Cog%20maps%20and%20cog%20graphs.pdf)]. Humans and animals use mental representations of the spatial structure of the world to navigate. The classical view is that these representations take the form of Euclidean cognitive maps, but alternative theories suggest that they are cognitive graphs consisting of locations connected by paths. The authors review evidence suggesting that both map-like and graph-like representations exist in the mind/brain that rely on partially overlapping neural systems. Maps and graphs can operate simultaneously or separately, and they may be applied to both spatial and nonspatial knowledge. By providing structural frameworks for complex information, cognitive maps and cognitive graphs may provide fundamental organizing schemata that allow us to navigate in physical, social, and conceptual spaces.
*   [Natural speech reveals the semantic maps that tile human cerebral cortex](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature17637) - ***Nature***, 2016. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14997953800741854188)]. \[[Preprint](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/cbs/rclcn/images/cdl_articles/H/Huth_et_al._2016.pdf)]. \[[Code & Tutorial (‚≠ê34)](https://github.com/HuthLab/speechmodeltutorial)]. The meaning of language is represented in regions of the cerebral cortex collectively known as the ‚Äòsemantic system‚Äô. However, little of the semantic system has been mapped comprehensively, and the semantic selectivity of most regions is unknown. This work systematically maps semantic selectivity across the cortex using voxel-wise modelling of functional MRI (fMRI) data collected while subjects listened to hours of narrative stories. This work shows that the semantic system is organized into intricate patterns that seem to be consistent across individuals. The authors then use a novel generative model to create a detailed semantic atlas. The results suggest that most areas within the semantic system represent information about specific semantic domains, or groups of related concepts, and the atlas shows which domains are represented in each area. This study demonstrates that data-driven methods---commonplace in studies of human neuroanatomy and functional connectivity---provide a powerful and efficient means for mapping functional representations in the brain.

Humans primarily rely on language to communicate, on the basis of a shared understanding of the basic building blocks of communication: words. Do we mean the same things when we use the same words? Although cognitive neural research on semantics has revealed the common principles of word-meaning representation, the factors underlying the potential individual variations in word meanings are unknown. This work empirically characterized the intersubject consistency of 90 words across 20 adult subjects (10 female) using both behavioral measures (rating-based semantic-relationship patterns) and neuroimaging measures (word-evoked brain activity patterns). Across both the behavioral and neuroimaging experiments, this work showed that the magnitude of individual disagreements on word meanings could be modeled on the basis of how much language or sensory experience is associated with a word and that this variation increases with word abstractness. Uncovering the cognitive and neural origins of word-meaning disagreements across individuals has implications for potential mechanisms to modulate such disagreements.

### Concepts / Human Concept Representation

*   [Organizing conceptual knowledge in humans with a gridlike code](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.aaf0941) - ***Science***, 2016. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=10995575332310321503)]. \[[Preprint](http://behavioralhealth2000.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Organizing-conceptual-knowledge-in-humans-with-a-gridlike-code.pdf)]. It has been hypothesized that the brain organizes concepts into a mental map, allowing conceptual relationships to be navigated in a manner similar to that of space. Grid cells use a hexagonally symmetric code to organize spatial representations and are the likely source of a precise hexagonal symmetry in the functional magnetic resonance imaging signal. Humans navigating conceptual two-dimensional knowledge showed the same hexagonal signal in a set of brain regions markedly similar to those activated during spatial navigation. This gridlike signal is consistent across sessions acquired within an hour and more than a week apart. This work's findings suggest that global relational codes may be used to organize nonspatial conceptual representations and that these codes may have a hexagonal gridlike pattern when conceptual knowledge is laid out in two continuous dimensions.

### Domain Specific Language / Design Practises

*   [Abstract Hardware Grounding Towards the Automated Design of Automation Systems](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-96-0780-8_9) - ***ICIRA'24***, 2024. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3331524500088540378)]. Crafting automation systems tailored for specific domains requires aligning the space of human experts‚Äô semantics with the space of robot executable actions, and scheduling the required resources and system layout accordingly. Regrettably, there are three major gaps, fine-grained domain-specific knowledge injection, heterogeneity between human knowledge and robot instructions, and diversity of users‚Äô preferences, resulting automation system design a case-by-case and labour-intensive effort, thus hindering the democratization of automation. This work refers to this challenging alignment as the abstract hardware grounding problem, where the authors firstly regard the procedural operations in humans‚Äô semantics space as the abstraction of hardware requirements, then the authors ground such abstractions to instantiated hardware devices, subject to constraints and preferences in the real world‚Äîoptimizing this problem is essentially standardizing and automating the design of automation systems. On this basis, this work develops an automated design framework in a hybrid data-driven and principle-derived fashion. Results on designing self-driving laboratories for enhancing experiment-driven scientific discovery suggest the proposed framework‚Äôs potential to produce compact systems that fully satisfy domain-specific and user-customized requirements with no redundancy.

Recent development in Artificial Intelligence (AI) models has propelled their application in scientific discovery, but the validation and exploration of these discoveries require subsequent empirical experimentation. The concept of self-driving laboratories promises to automate and thus boost the experimental process following AI-driven discoveries. However, the transition of experimental protocols, originally crafted for human comprehension, into formats interpretable by machines presents significant challenges, which, within the context of specific expert domain, encompass the necessity for structured as opposed to natural language, the imperative for explicit rather than tacit knowledge, and the preservation of causality and consistency throughout protocol steps. Presently, the task of protocol translation predominantly requires the manual and labor-intensive involvement of domain experts and information technology specialists, rendering the process time-intensive. To address these issues, this work proposes a framework that automates the protocol translation process through a three-stage workflow, which incrementally constructs Protocol Dependence Graphs (PDGs) that approach structured on the syntax level, completed on the semantics level, and linked on the execution level. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations have demonstrated its performance at par with that of human experts, underscoring its potential to significantly expedite and democratize the process of scientific discovery by elevating the automation capabilities within self-driving laboratories.

### Bayesian Modeling / Nonparametric Model

*   [Nonparametric Bayesian Logic](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.5555/3020336.3020347) - ***UAI'05***, 2005. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=18267211625980322095)]. \[[Preprint](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~nando/papers/npblog.pdf)]. The Bayesian Logic (BLOG) language was recently developed for defining first-order probability models over worlds with unknown numbers of objects. It handles important problems in AI, including data association and population estimation. This paper extends BLOG by adopting generative processes over function spaces ‚Äî known as nonparametrics in the Bayesian literature. This work introduces syntax for reasoning about arbitrary collections of objects, and their properties, in an intuitive manner. By exploiting exchangeability, distributions over unknown objects and their attributes are cast as Dirichlet processes, which resolve difficulties in model selection and inference caused by varying numbers of objects.

Relational learning analyzes the probabilistic constraints between the attributes of entities and relationships. This work extends the expressiveness of relational models by introducing for each entity (or object) an infinite-dimensional latent variable as part of a Dirichlet process (DP) mixture model. This work discusses inference in the model, which is based on a DP Gibbs sampler, i.e., the Chinese restaurant process. The authors extended the Chinese restaurant process to be applicable to relational modeling.

### Bayesian Modeling / Bayesian Optimization

*   [Taking the Human Out of the Loop: A Review of Bayesian Optimization](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7352306) - ***Proceedings of the IEEE***, 2015. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2039456143890648437)]. \[[Preprint](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~rpa/pubs/shahriari2016loop.pdf)]. Big Data applications are typically associated with systems involving large numbers of users, massive complex software systems, and large-scale heterogeneous computing and storage architectures. The construction of such systems involves many distributed design choices. The end products (e.g., recommendation systems, medical analysis tools, real-time game engines, speech recognizers) thus involve many tunable configuration parameters. These parameters are often specified and hard-coded into the software by various developers or teams. If optimized jointly, these parameters can result in significant improvements. Bayesian optimization is a powerful tool for the joint optimization of design choices that is gaining great popularity in recent years. It promises greater automation so as to increase both product quality and human productivity. This review paper introduces Bayesian optimization, highlights some of its methodological aspects, and showcases a wide range of applications.
*   [Practical Bayesian Optimization of Machine Learning Algorithms](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2012/hash/05311655a15b75fab86956663e1819cd-Abstract.html) - ***NeurIPS'12***, 2012. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14442949298925775705)]. The use of machine learning algorithms frequently involves careful tuning of learning parameters and model hyperparameters. Unfortunately, this tuning is often a ‚Äúblack art‚Äù requiring expert experience, rules of thumb, or sometimes brute-force search. There is therefore great appeal for automatic approaches that can optimize the performance of any given learning algorithm to the problem at hand. This work considers this problem through the framework of Bayesian optimization, in which a learning algorithm‚Äôs generalization performance is modeled as a sample from a Gaussian process (GP). The authors show that certain choices for the nature of the GP, such as the type of kernel and the treatment of its hyperparameters, can play a crucial role in obtaining a good optimizer that can achieve expert-level performance. The authors describe new algorithms that take into account the variable cost (duration) of learning algorithm experiments and that can leverage the presence of multiple cores for parallel experimentation. These proposed algorithms improve on previous automatic procedures and can reach or surpass human expert-level optimization for many algorithms including Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Structured SVMs and convolutional neural networks.

Achieving human-like planning and control with multimodal observations in an open world is a key milestone for more functional generalist agents. Existing approaches can handle certain long-horizon tasks in an open world. However, they still struggle when the number of open-world tasks could potentially be infinite and lack the capability to progressively enhance task completion as game time progresses. This work introduces JARVIS-1, an open-world agent that can perceive multimodal input (visual observations and human instructions), generate sophisticated plans, and perform embodied control, all within the popular yet challenging open-world Minecraft universe. Specifically, the authors develop JARVIS-1 on top of pre-trained multimodal language models, which map visual observations and textual instructions to plans. The plans will be ultimately dispatched to the goal-conditioned controllers. JARVIS-1 is outfitted with a multimodal memory, which facilitates planning using both pre-trained knowledge and its actual game survival experiences. JARVIS-1 is the existing most general agent in Minecraft, capable of completing over 200 different tasks using control and observation space similar to humans.

### Bayesian Modeling / Generative Model

*   [Cooperative Training of Descriptor and Generator Networks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8519332) - ***IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence***, 2018. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=18202808849093155435)]. This paper studies the cooperative training of two generative models for image modeling and synthesis. Both models are parametrized by convolutional neural networks (ConvNets). The first model is a deep energy-based model, whose energy function is defined by a bottom-up ConvNet, which maps the observed image to the energy. We call it the descriptor network. The second model is a generator network, which is a non-linear version of factor analysis. It is defined by a top-down ConvNet, which maps the latent factors to the observed image. The maximum likelihood learning algorithms of both models involve MCMC sampling such as Langevin dynamics. This work observes that the two learning algorithms can be seamlessly interwoven into a cooperative learning algorithm that can train both models simultaneously. Specifically, within each iteration of the cooperative learning algorithm, the generator model generates initial synthesized examples to initialize a finite-step MCMC that samples and trains the energy-based descriptor model. After that, the generator model learns from how the MCMC changes its synthesized examples. That is, the descriptor model teaches the generator model by MCMC, so that the generator model accumulates the MCMC transitions and reproduces them by direct ancestral sampling.

This paper provides new insights on the Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm. The authors show that this method can be formulated as the first order optimization algorithm for an objective functional defined on the Wasserstein space of order $2$. Using this interpretation and techniques borrowed from convex optimization, the authors give a non-asymptotic analysis of this method to sample from log-concave smooth target distribution on $\mathbb{R}^d$. Based on this interpretation, the authors propose two new methods for sampling from a non-smooth target distribution. These new algorithms are natural extensions of the Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) algorithm, which is a popular extension of the Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm for largescale Bayesian inference. Using the optimization perspective, the authors provide non-asymptotic convergence analysis for the newly proposed methods.

Why are human inferences sometimes remarkably close to the Bayesian ideal and other times systematically biased? In particular, why do humans make near-rational inferences in some natural domains where the candidate hypotheses are explicitly available, whereas tasks in similar domains requiring the self-generation of hypotheses produce systematic deviations from rational inference. This work proposes that these deviations arise from algorithmic processes approximating Bayes‚Äô rule. Specifically in our account, hypotheses are generated stochastically from a sampling process, such that the sampled hypotheses form a Monte Carlo approximation of the posterior.

Digital extended reality (XR) technologies have been adopted in various domains ranging from entertainment to education because of their accessibility and affordability. XR modalities create an immersive experience, enabling 3D visualization of the content without a conventional 2D display constraint. This paper provides a perspective on XR in current biomedical applications and demonstrate case studies using cell biology concepts, multiplexed proteomics images, surgical data for heart operations, and cardiac 3D models. Emerging challenges associated with XR technologies in the context of adverse health effects and a cost comparison of distinct platforms are discussed. The presented XR platforms will be useful for biomedical education, medical training, surgical guidance, and molecular data visualization to enhance trainees‚Äô and students‚Äô learning, medical operation accuracy, and the comprehensibility of complex biological systems.

The microscopic assessment of tissue samples is instrumental for the diagnosis and staging of cancer, and thus guides therapy. However, these assessments demonstrate considerable variability and many regions of the world lack access to trained pathologists. Though artificial intelligence (AI) promises to improve the access and quality of healthcare, the costs of image digitization in pathology and difficulties in deploying AI solutions remain as barriers to real-world use. This work proposes a cost-effective solution: the augmented reality microscope (ARM). The ARM overlays AI-based information onto the current view of the sample in real time, enabling seamless integration of AI into routine workflows.

We perceive the shapes and material properties of objects quickly and reliably despite the complexity and objective ambiguities of natural images. Typical images are highly complex because they consist of many objects embedded in background clutter. Moreover, the image features of an object are extremely variable and ambiguous owing to the effects of projection, occlusion, background clutter, and illumination. The very success of everyday vision implies neural mechanisms, yet to be understood, that discount irrelevant information and organize ambiguous or noisy local image features into objects and surfaces. Recent work in Bayesian theories of visual perception has shown how complexity may be managed and ambiguity resolved through the task-dependent, probabilistic integration of prior object knowledge with image features.

This paper presents a computational paradigm called Data-Driven Markov Chain Monte Carlo (DDMCMC) for image segmentation in the Bayesian statistical framework. The paper contributes to image segmentation in four aspects. First, it designs efficient and well-balanced Markov Chain dynamics to explore the complex solution space and, thus, achieves a nearly global optimal solution independent of initial segmentations. Second, it presents a mathematical principle and a K-adventurers algorithm for computing multiple distinct solutions from the Markov chain sequence and, thus, it incorporates intrinsic ambiguities in image segmentation. Third, it utilizes data-driven (bottom-up) techniques, such as clustering and edge detection, to compute importance proposal probabilities, which drive the Markov chain dynamics and achieve tremendous speedup in comparison to the traditional jump-diffusion methods. Fourth, the DDMCMC paradigm provides a unifying framework in which the role of many existing segmentation algorithms, such as, edge detection, clustering, region growing, split-merge, snake/balloon, and region competition, are revealed as either realizing Markov chain dynamics or computing importance proposal probabilities. Thus, the DDMCMC paradigm combines and generalizes these segmentation methods in a principled way.

Learning from a few examples and generalizing to markedly different situations are capabilities of human visual intelligence that are yet to be matched by leading machine learning models. By drawing inspiration from systems neuroscience, this work introduces a probabilistic generative model for vision in which message-passing‚Äìbased inference handles recognition, segmentation, and reasoning in a unified way. The model demonstrates excellent generalization and occlusion-reasoning capabilities and outperforms deep neural networks on a challenging scene text recognition benchmark while being 300-fold more data efficient. In addition, the model fundamentally breaks the defense of modern text-based CAPTCHAs (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) by generatively segmenting characters without CAPTCHA-specific heuristics.

The automatic analysis of patent publications has potential to accelerate research across various domains, including drug discovery and material science. Within patent documents, crucial information often resides in visual depictions of molecule structures. PatCID (Patent-extracted Chemical-structure Images database for Discovery) allows to access such information at scale. It enables users to search which molecules are displayed in which documents. PatCID contains 81M chemical-structure images and 14M unique chemical structures. This work compares PatCID with state-of-the-art chemical patent-databases. On a random set, PatCID retrieves 56.0% of molecules, which is higher than automatically-created databases, Google Patents (41.5%) and SureChEMBL (23.5%), as well as manually-created databases, Reaxys (53.5%) and SciFinder (49.5%). Leveraging state-of-the-art methods of document understanding, PatCID high-quality data outperforms currently available automatically-generated patent-databases. PatCID even competes with proprietary manually-created patent-databases. This enables promising applications for automatic literature review and learning-based molecular generation methods.

The authors present a Bayesian framework for understanding how adults and children learn the meanings of words. The theory explains how learners can generalize meaningfully from just one or a few positive examples of a novel word's referents, by making rational inductive inferences that integrate prior knowledge about plausible word meanings with the statistical structure of the observed examples. The theory addresses shortcomings of the two best known approaches to modeling word learning, based on deductive hypothesis elimination and associative learning. Three experiments with adults and children test the Bayesian account's predictions in the context of learning words for object categories at multiple levels of a taxonomic hierarchy. Results provide strong support for the Bayesian account over competing accounts, in terms of both quantitative model fits and the ability to explain important qualitative phenomena. Several extensions of the basic theory are discussed, illustrating the broader potential for Bayesian models of word learning.

This review describes recent approaches to reverse-engineering human learning and cognitive development and, in parallel, engineering more humanlike machine learning systems. Computational models that perform probabilistic inference over hierarchies of flexibly structured representations can address some of the deepest questions about the nature and origins of human thought: How does abstract knowledge guide learning and reasoning from sparse data? What forms does our knowledge take, across different domains and tasks? And how is that abstract knowledge itself acquired?

People learning new concepts can often generalize successfully from just a single example, yet machine learning algorithms typically require tens or hundreds of examples to perform with similar accuracy. People can also use learned concepts in richer ways than conventional algorithms‚Äîfor action, imagination, and explanation. This work presents a computational model that captures these human learning abilities for a large class of simple visual concepts: handwritten characters from the world‚Äôs alphabets. The model represents concepts as simple programs that best explain observed examples under a Bayesian criterion. On a challenging one-shot classification task, the model achieves human-level performance while outperforming recent deep learning approaches.

Recent progress in artificial intelligence has renewed interest in building systems that learn and think like people. Many advances have come from using deep neural networks trained end-to-end in tasks such as object recognition, video games, and board games, achieving performance that equals or even beats that of humans in some respects. Despite their biological inspiration and performance achievements, these systems differ from human intelligence in crucial ways. The authors review progress in cognitive science suggesting that truly human-like learning and thinking machines will have to reach beyond current engineering trends in both what they learn and how they learn it. Specifically, the authors argue that these machines should (1) build causal models of the world that support explanation and understanding, rather than merely solving pattern recognition problems; (2) ground learning in intuitive theories of physics and psychology to support and enrich the knowledge that is learned; and (3) harness compositionality and learning-to-learn to rapidly acquire and generalize knowledge to new tasks and situations. The authors suggest concrete challenges and promising routes toward these goals that can combine the strengths of recent neural network advances with more structured cognitive models.

This article presents a statistical theory for texture modeling. This theory combines filtering theory and Markov random field modeling through the maximum entropy principle, and interprets and clarifies many previous concepts and methods for texture analysis and synthesis from a unified point of view. The theory characterizes the ensemble of images I with the same texture appearance by a probability distribution f(I) on a random field, and the objective of texture modeling is to make inference about f(I), given a set of observed texture examples.

The pattern theory of Grenander is a mathematical framework where patterns are represented by probability models on random variables of algebraic structures. In this paper, the authors review three families of probability models, namely, the discriminative models, the descriptive models, and the generative models. A discriminative model is in the form of a classifier. It specifies the conditional probability of the class label given the input signal. A descriptive model specifies the probability distribution of the signal, based on an energy function defined on the signal. A generative model assumes that the signal is generated by some latent variables via a transformation. The authors shall review these models within a common framework and explore their connections, and shall also review the recent developments that take advantage of the high approximation capacities of deep neural networks.

One fundamental property of natural image data that distinguishes vision from other sensory tasks such as speech recognition is that scale plays a profound role in image formation and interpretation. Specifically, visual objects can appear at a wide range of scales in the images due to the change of viewing distance as well as camera resolution. The same objects appearing at different scales produce different image data with different statistical properties. In particular, this work shows that the entropy rate of the image data changes over scale. Moreover, the inferential uncertainty changes over scale too. The authors call these changes information scaling. They then examine both empirically and theoretically two prominent and yet largely isolated classes of image models, namely, wavelet sparse coding models and Markov random field models. The results indicate that the two classes of models are appropriate for two different entropy regimes: sparse coding targets low entropy regimes, whereas Markov random fields are appropriate for high entropy regimes. Because information scaling connects different entropy regimes, both sparse coding and Markov random fields are necessary for representing natural image data, and information scaling triggers transitions between these two regimes.
*   [Minimax entropy principle and its application to texture modeling](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6796444) - ***Neural Computing***, 1997. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=407872717119429940)]. \[[Preprint](https://www.dam.brown.edu/people/mumford/vision/papers/1997e--MinimaxEntropy-NC.pdf)]. This article proposes a general theory and methodology, called the minimax entropy principle, for building statistical models for images (or signals) in a variety of applications. This principle consists of two parts. The first is the maximum entropy principle for feature binding (or fusion): for a given set of observed feature statistics, a distribution can be built to bind these feature statistics together by maximizing the entropy over all distributions that reproduce them. The second part is the minimum entropy principle for feature selection: among all plausible sets of feature statistics, we choose the set whose maximum entropy distribution has the minimum entropy. Computational and inferential issues in both parts are addressed; in particular, a feature pursuit procedure is proposed for approximately selecting the optimal set of features. The minimax entropy principle is then corrected by considering the sample variation in the observed feature statistics, and an information criterion for feature pursuit is derived. The minimax entropy principle is applied to texture modeling, where a novel Markov random field (MRF) model, called FRAME (filter, random field, and minimax entropy), is derived, and encouraging results are obtained in experiments on a variety of texture images.

Viewing the observed data of a statistical model as incomplete and augmenting its missing parts are useful for clarifying concepts and central to the invention of two well-known statistical algorithms: expectation-maximization (EM) and data augmentation. Recently, the authors demonstrated that expanding the parameter space along with augmenting the missing data is useful for accelerating iterative computation in an EM algorithm. The main purpose of this article is to rigorously define a parameter expanded data augmentation (PX-DA) algorithm and to study its theoretical properties. The PX-DA is a special way of using auxiliary variables to accelerate Gibbs sampling algorithms and is closely related to reparameterization techniques.

A position paper on DSL for data-driven storytelling. Data-driven storytelling serves as a crucial bridge for communicating ideas in a persuasive way. However, the manual creation of data stories is a multifaceted, labor-intensive, and case-specific effort, limiting their broader application. As a result, automating the creation of data stories has emerged as a significant research thrust. Despite advances in Artificial Intelligence, the systematic generation of data stories remains challenging due to their hybrid nature: they must frame a perspective based on a seed idea in a top-down manner, similar to traditional storytelling, while coherently grounding insights of given evidence in a bottom-up fashion, akin to data analysis. These dual requirements necessitate precise constraints on the permissible space of a data story. This viewpoint proposes integrating constraints into the data story generation process. Defined upon the hierarchies of interpretation and articulation, constraints shape both narrations and illustrations to align with seed ideas and contextualized evidence. The authors identify the taxonomy and required functionalities of these constraints. Although constraints can be heterogeneous and latent, this position paper explores the potential to represent them in a computation-friendly fashion via Domain-Specific Languages. The authors believe that leveraging constraints will facilitate both artistic and scientific aspects of data story generation.

One of the most astonishing features of human language is its capacity to convey information efficiently in context. Many theories provide informal accounts of communicative inference, yet there have been few successes in making precise, quantitative predictions about pragmatic reasoning. This work examined judgments about simple referential communication games, modeling behavior in these games by assuming that speakers attempt to be informative and that listeners use Bayesian inference to recover speakers‚Äô intended referents. The model provides a close, parameter-free fit to human judgments, suggesting that the use of information-theoretic tools to predict pragmatic reasoning may lead to more effective formal models of communication.

The present study sets out to experimentally investigate how environmental factors come to shape the emergence of linguistic conventions. To this end, the authors adapt the classical Maze Game task to test the hypothesis that participants routinise different linguistic strategies to communicate positions in the maze contingent on particular environmental affordances (i.e. structure of the mazes). The results confirm that subtle environmental motivations drive the emergence of different communicative conventions in an otherwise identical task, suggesting that linguistic adaptations are highly sensitive to factors of the shared task environment.

Usability evaluation is often skipped, relaxed, or at least omitted from papers reporting development of DSLs. The authors argue that a systematic approach based on User Interface experimental validation techniques should be used to assess the impact of new DSLs. For that purpose, the authors propose to merge common Usability evaluation processes with the DSL development process.

Domain-specific languages (DSLs) are languages tailored to a specific application domain. They offer substantial gains in expressiveness and ease of use compared with general-purpose programming languages in their domain of application. DSL development is hard, requiring both domain knowledge and language development expertise. Few people have both. Not surprisingly, the decision to develop a DSL is often postponed indefinitely, if considered at all, and most DSLs never get beyond the application library stage. Although many articles have been written on the development of particular DSLs, there is very limited literature on DSL development methodologies and many questions remain regarding when and how to develop a DSL. To aid the DSL developer, this survey paper identifies patterns in the decision, analysis, design, and implementation phases of DSL development. These patterns improve and extend earlier work on DSL design patterns.

This paper presents a precise definition of qualitative structure and behavior descriptions as abstractions of differential equations and continuously differentiable functions. The authors present a new algorithm for qualitative simulation that generalizes the best features of existing algorithms, and allows direct comparisons among alternate approaches. Starting with a set of constraints abstracted from a differential equation, this work proves that the QSIM algorithm is guaranteed to produce a qualitative behavior corresponding to any solution to the original equation. The paper also shows that any qualitative simulation algorithm will sometimes produce spurious qualitative behaviors: ones which do not correspond to any mechanism satisfying the given constraints. These observations suggest specific types of care that must be taken in designing applications of qualitative causal reasoning systems, and in constructing and validating a knowledge base of mechanism descriptions.

This paper introduces corpus-guided top-down synthesis as a mechanism for synthesizing library functions that capture common functionality from a corpus of programs in a domain specific language (DSL).

*   [Bayesian modeling of human concept learning](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/1998/hash/d010396ca8abf6ead8cacc2c2f2f26c7-Abstract.html) - ***NeurIPS'98***, 1998. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3772493362518191863)]. \[[Preprint](http://web.mit.edu/cocosci/archive/Papers/bayes.pdf)]. This work considers the problem of learning concepts from small numbers of positive examples, a feat which humans perform routinely but which computers are rarely capable of. Bridging machine learning and cognitive science perspectives, this work presents both theoretical analysis and an empirical study with human subjects for the simple task oflearning concepts corresponding to axis-aligned rectangles in a multidimensional feature space. Existing learning models, when applied to this task, cannot explain how subjects generalize from only a few examples of the concept. The author proposes a principled Bayesian model based on the assumption that the examples are a random sample from the concept to be learned. The model gives precise fits to human behavior on this simple task and provides qualitati ve insights into more complex, realistic cases of concept learning.
*   [Rules and Similarity in Concept Learning](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/1999/hash/86d7c8a08b4aaa1bc7c599473f5dddda-Abstract.html) - ***NeurIPS'99***, 1999. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=10968021160883668417)]. \[[Preprint](http://web.mit.edu/cocosci/archive/Papers/nips99preprint.pdf)]. This paper argues that two apparently distinct modes of generalizing concepts - abstracting rules and computing similarity to exemplars - should both be seen as special cases of a more general Bayesian learning framework. Bayes explains the specific workings of these two modes - which rules are abstracted, how similarity is measured - as well as why generalization should appear rule- or similarity-based in different situations. This analysis also suggests why the rules/similarity distinction, even if not computationally fundamental, may still be useful at the algorithmic level as part of a principled approximation to fully Bayesian learning.

### Domain Specific Language / Cognitive Foundations

*   [Symbolic metaprogram search improves learning efficiency and explains rule learning in humans](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50966-x) - ***Nature Communications***, 2024. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7670274141609367282)]. Symbolic models based on program learning successfully explain rule-learning in many domains, but performance degrades quickly as program complexity increases. It remains unclear how to scale symbolic rule-learning methods to model human performance in challenging domains. This work shows that symbolic search over the space of metaprograms‚Äîprograms that revise programs‚Äîdramatically improves learning efficiency. On a behavioral benchmark of 100 algorithmically rich rules, this approach fits human learning more accurately than alternative models while also using orders of magnitude less search. The computation required to match median human performance is consistent with conservative estimates of human thinking time. The results suggest that metaprogram-like representations may help human learners to efficiently acquire rules.

### Abduction / Applications in AI

*   [Abduction in Logic Programming](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-45628-7_16) - ***Computational Logic***, 2002. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=902643678163312237)]. \[[Preprint](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs227/Readings/Abudction%20in%20LP.pdf)]. Abduction in Logic Programming started in the late 80s, early 90s, in an attempt to extend logic programming into a framework suitable for a variety of problems in Artificial Intelligence and other areas of Computer Science. This paper aims to chart out the main developments of the field over the last ten years and to take a critical view of these developments from several perspectives: logical, epistemological, computational and suitability to application. The paper attempts to expose some of the challenges and prospects for the further development of the field.

### Concepts / Human Concept Representation

*   [Why concepts are (probably) vectors](https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/abstract/S1364-6613\(24\)00171-2) - ***Trends in Cognitive Sciences***, 2024. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4315363807034184312)]. For decades, cognitive scientists have debated what kind of representation might characterize human concepts. Whatever the format of the representation, it must allow for the computation of varied properties, including similarities, features, categories, definitions, and relations. It must also support the development of theories, ad hoc categories, and knowledge of procedures. Here, the authors discuss why vector-based representations provide a compelling account that can meet all these needs while being plausibly encoded into neural architectures. This view has become especially promising with recent advances in both large language models and vector symbolic architectures. These innovations show how vectors can handle many properties traditionally thought to be out of reach for neural models, including compositionality, definitions, structures, and symbolic computational processes.

### Domain Specific Language / Cognitive Foundations

*   [The Child as Hacker](https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613\(20\)30174-1) - ***Trends in Cognitive Sciences***, 2020. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13128656954836679743)]. The scope of human learning and development poses a radical challenge for cognitive science. The authors propose that developmental theories can address this challenge by adopting perspectives from computer science. Many of our best models treat learning as analogous to computer programming because symbolic programs provide the most compelling account of sophisticated mental representations. The authors specifically propose that children‚Äôs learning is analogous to a particular style of programming called hacking, making code better along many dimensions through an open-ended set of goals and activities. By contrast to existing theories, which depend primarily on local search and simple metrics, this view highlights the many features of good mental representations and the multiple complementary processes children use to create them.

### Abduction / Applications in AI

*   [Abductive Logic Programming](https://academic.oup.com/logcom/article-abstract/2/6/719/942121) - ***Journal of Logic Computation***, 1992. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=18119357517656745518)]. This paper is a survey and critical overview of recent work on the extension of logic programming to perform abductive reasoning (abductive logic programming). The authors outline the general framework of abduction and its applications to knowledge assimilation and default reasoning; and they introduce an argumentation-theoretic approach to the use of abduction as an interpretation for negation as failure.
*   [Bayesian Abductive Logic Programs: A Probabilistic Logic for Abductive Reasoning](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.5555/2283696.2283887) - ***IJCAI'11***, 2011. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4453424083730209198)]. \[[Preprint](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~ml/papers/raghavan.starai10.pdf)]. This work introduces Bayesian Abductive Logic Programs (BALP), a probabilistic logic that adapts Bayesian Logic Programs (BLPs) for abductive reasoning. Like BLPs, BALPs also combine first-order logic and Bayes nets. However, unlike BLPs, which use deduction to construct Bayes nets, BALPs employ logical abduction. As a result, BALPs are more suited for problems like plan/activity recognition that require abductive reasoning.

### Bayesian Modeling / Bayesian Induction

*   [Probabilistic machine learning and artificial intelligence](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14541) - ***Nature***, 2015. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1783282361269717744)]. Probabilistic modelling provides a framework for understanding what learning is, and has therefore emerged as one of the principal theoretical and practical approaches for designing machines that learn from data acquired through experience. The probabilistic framework, which describes how to represent and manipulate uncertainty about models and predictions, has a central role in scientific data analysis, machine learning, robotics, cognitive science and artificial intelligence. This Review provides an introduction to this framework, and discusses some of the state-of-the-art advances in the field, namely, probabilistic programming, Bayesian optimization, data compression and automatic model discovery.
*   [Generalization, similarity, and Bayesian inference](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/generalization-similarity-and-bayesian-inference/595CAA321C9C56270C624057021DE77A) - ***Behavioral and Brain Sciences***, 2001. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14074987155133342565)]. \[[Preprint](http://web.mit.edu/cocosci/archive/Papers/tenenbaum_griffiths01.pdf)]. Shepard has argued that a universal law should govern generalization across different domains of perception and cognition, as well as across organisms from different species or even different planets. Starting with some basic assumptions about natural kinds, he derived an exponential decay function as the form of the universal generalization gradient, which accords strikingly well with a wide range of empirical data. However, his original formulation applied only to the ideal case of generalization from a single encountered stimulus to a single novel stimulus, and for stimuli that can be represented as points in a continuous metric psychological space. The authors recast Shepard's theory in a more general Bayesian framework and show how this naturally extends his approach to the more realistic situation of generalizing from multiple consequential stimuli with arbitrary representational structure. This framework also subsumes a version of Tversky's set-theoretic model of similarity, which is conventionally thought of as the primary alternative to Shepard's continuous metric space model of similarity and generalization.

### Communications / Language Compositionality

*   [Language is primarily a tool for communication rather than thought](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07522-w) - ***Nature***, 2024. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13724799649075764503)]. This perspective brings recent evidence from neuroscience and allied disciplines to argue that in modern humans, language is a tool for communication, contrary to a prominent view that we use language for thinking. The authors begins by introducing the brain network that supports linguistic ability in humans. They then review evidence for a double dissociation between language and thought, and discuss several properties of language that suggest that it is optimized for communication. This perspective concludes that although the emergence of language has unquestionably transformed human culture, language does not appear to be a prerequisite for complex thought, including symbolic thought. Instead, language is a powerful tool for the transmission of cultural knowledge; it plausibly co-evolved with humans' thinking and reasoning capacities, and only reflects, rather than gives rise to, the signature sophistication of human cognition.

### Domain Specific Language / Declarative DSL Applications

*   [The Scene Language: Representing Scenes with Programs, Words, and Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16770) - ***CVPR'25***, 2025. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=8704845413716059914)]. \[[Project](https://ai.stanford.edu/~yzzhang/projects/scene-language/)]. This paper introduces the Scene Language, a visual scene representation that concisely and precisely describes the structure, semantics, and identity of visual scenes. It represents a scene with three key components: a program that specifies the hierarchical and relational structure of entities in the scene, words in natural language that summarize the semantic class of each entity, and embeddings that capture the visual identity of each entity. This representation can be inferred from pre-trained language models via a training-free inference technique, given text or image inputs.

### Methodologies for Experiments / Virtual Reality

*   [What's the Game, then? Opportunities and Challenges for Runtime Behavior Generation](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3654777.3676358) - ***UIST'24***, 2024. \[[All Versions](https://github.com/SHI-Yu-Zhe/awesome-agi-cocosci/blob/master/README.md/)]. Procedural content generation (PCG), the process of algorithmically creating game components instead of manually, has been a common tool of game development for decades. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) enable the generation of game behaviors based on player input at runtime. Such code generation brings with it the possibility of entirely new gameplay interactions that may be difficult to integrate with typical game development workflows. This work explores these implications through GROMIT, a novel LLM-based runtime behavior generation system for Unity. When triggered by a player action, GROMIT generates a relevant behavior which is compiled without developer intervention and incorporated into the game.

### Meta-Level Considerations / Rationality

*   [Understanding Human Intelligence through Human Limitations](https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613\(20\)30215-1) - ***Trends in Cognitive Sciences***, 2020. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs\&hl=en\&cluster=6469796133334580403)]. \[[Preprint](https://cocosci.princeton.edu/papers/griffiths_understanding.pdf)]. Recent progress in artificial intelligence provides the opportunity to ask the question of what is unique about human intelligence, but with a new comparison class. The author argues that we can understand human intelligence, and the ways in which it may differ from artificial intelligence, by considering the characteristics of the kind of computational problems that human minds have to solve. The author claims that these problems acquire their structure from three fundamental limitations that apply to human beings: limited time, limited computation, and limited communication. From these limitations we can derive many of the properties we associate with human intelligence, such as rapid learning, the ability to break down problems into parts, and the capacity for cumulative cultural evolution.

### Bayesian Modeling / Bayesian Induction

*   [Theory-based Bayesian models of inductive learning and reasoning](https://www.cell.com/AJHG/fulltext/S1364-6613\(06\)00134-3) - ***Trends in Cognitive Sciences***, 2006. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=6741344960992898446)]. \[[Preprint](http://www.charleskemp.com/papers/TenenbaumGK06.pdf)]. Inductive inference allows humans to make powerful generalizations from sparse data when learning about word meanings, unobserved properties, causal relationships, and many other aspects of the world. Traditional accounts of induction emphasize either the power of statistical learning, or the importance of strong constraints from structured domain knowledge, intuitive theories or schemas. This paper argues that both components are necessary to explain the nature, use and acquisition of human knowledge, and the authors introduce a theory-based Bayesian framework for modeling inductive learning and reasoning as statistical inferences over structured knowledge representations.

### Concepts / Human Concept Representation

*   [Semantic projection recovers rich human knowledge of multiple object features from word embeddings](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-022-01316-8) - ***Nature Human Behavior***, 2022. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2499199921371106654)]. \[[Preprint](https://cap.csail.mit.edu/sites/default/files/research-pdfs/Semantic%20projection%20recovers%20rich%20human%20knowledge%20of%20multiple%20object%20features%20from%20word%20embeddings.pdf)]. How is knowledge about word meaning represented in the mental lexicon? Current computational models infer word meanings from lexical co-occurrence patterns. They learn to represent words as vectors in a multidimensional space, wherein words that are used in more similar linguistic contexts‚Äîthat is, are more semantically related‚Äîare located closer together. However, whereas inter-word proximity captures only overall relatedness, human judgements are highly context dependent. For example, dolphins and alligators are similar in size but differ in dangerousness. This work proposes a domain-general method to extract context-dependent relationships from word embeddings: ‚Äòsemantic projection‚Äô of word-vectors onto lines that represent features such as size (the line connecting the words ‚Äòsmall‚Äô and ‚Äòbig‚Äô) or danger (‚Äòsafe‚Äô to ‚Äòdangerous‚Äô), analogous to ‚Äòmental scales‚Äô. This method recovers human judgements across various object categories and properties. Thus, the geometry of word embeddings explicitly represents a wealth of context-dependent world knowledge.

### Bayesian Modeling / Bayesian Induction

*   [Building machines that learn and think with people](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-01991-9) - ***Nature Human Behavior***, 2024. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4420595706578245444)]. \[[Preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03943)]. This perspective shows how the science of collaborative cognition can be put to work to engineer systems that really can be called ‚Äòthought partners‚Äô, systems built to meet humans' expectations and complement humans' limitations. The authors lay out several modes of collaborative thought in which humans and artificial intelligence thought partners can engage, and they propose desiderata for human-compatible thought partnerships. Drawing on motifs from computational cognitive science, this work motivates an alternative scaling path for the design of thought partners and ecosystems around their use through a Bayesian lens, whereby the constructed partners actively build and reason over models of the human and world.

### Theory of Mind / AI Assisted Research

*   [Machine theory of mind](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/rabinowitz18a.html) - ***ICML'18***, 2018. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=6267278380616425333)]. Theory of mind (ToM) broadly refers to humans‚Äô ability to represent the mental states of others, including their desires, beliefs, and intentions. This work proposes a Theory of Mind neural network --- a ToMnet --- which uses meta-learning to build such models of the agents it encounters. The ToMnet learns a strong prior model for agents‚Äô future behaviour, and, using only a small number of behavioural observations, can bootstrap to richer predictions about agents‚Äô characteristics and mental states.

This paper presents a computational framework for understanding Theory of Mind (ToM): the human capacity for reasoning about agents‚Äô mental states such as beliefs and desires. The proposed Bayesian model of ToM (or BToM) expresses the predictive model of belief- and desire-dependent action at the heart of ToM as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), and reconstructs an agent‚Äôs joint belief state and reward function using Bayesian inference, conditioned on observations of the agent‚Äôs behavior in some environmental context.
*   [AGENT: A Benchmark for Core Psychological Reasoning](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/shu21a.html) - ***ICML'21***, 2021. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9729067071974484204)]. Inspired by cognitive development studies on intuitive psychology, this paper presents a benchmark consisting of a large dataset of procedurally generated 3D animations, AGENT (Action, Goal, Efficiency, coNstraint, uTility), structured around four scenarios (goal preferences, action efficiency, unobserved constraints, and cost-reward trade-offs) that probe key concepts of core intuitive psychology. The results suggest that to pass the designed tests of core intuitive psychology at human levels, a model must acquire or have built-in representations of how agents plan, combining utility computations and core knowledge of objects and physics.

This review article proposes that human social cognition is structured around a basic understanding of ourselves and others as intuitive utility maximizers: from a young age, humans implicitly assume that agents choose goals and actions to maximize the rewards they expect to obtain relative to the costs they expect to incur. This ‚Äòna√Øve utility calculus‚Äô allows both children and adults observe the behavior of others and infer their beliefs and desires, their longer-term knowledge and preferences, and even their character: who is knowledgeable or competent, who is praiseworthy or blameworthy, who is friendly, indifferent, or an enemy.

A perspective on understanding Theory of Mind through planning that consists of abstract structured causal representations and supports efficient search and selection from innumerable possible actions. Planning requires that Theory of Mind consists of abstract structured causal representations and supports efficient search and selection from innumerable possible actions. Theory of Mind contrasts with less cognitively demanding alternatives: statistical predictive models of other people‚Äôs actions, or model-free reinforcement of actions by their effects on other people. Theory of Mind is likely used to plan novel interventions and predict their effects, for example, in pedagogy, emotion regulation, and impression management.

This paper incorporates different nonverbal communication cues (e.g., gaze, human poses, and gestures) to represent, model, learn, and infer agents' mental states from pure visual inputs. Crucially, such a mental representation takes the agent's belief into account so that it represents what the true world state is and infers the beliefs in each agent's mental state, which may differ from the true world states. By aggregating different beliefs and true world states, the model essentially forms "five minds" during the interactions between two agents. This "five minds" model differs from prior works that infer beliefs in an infinite recursion; instead, agents' beliefs are converged into a "common mind". Based on this representation, this work further devises a hierarchical energy-based model that jointly tracks and predicts all five minds. From this new perspective, a social event is interpreted by a series of nonverbal communication and belief dynamics, which transcends the classic keyframe video summary.

The original paper on the automated design of DSLs, referred to as AutoDSL. Accurate representation of procedures in restricted scenarios, such as non-standardized scientific experiments, requires precise depiction of constraints. Unfortunately, Domain-Specific Language (DSL), as an effective tool to express constraints structurally, often requires case-by-case hand-crafting, necessitating customized, labor-intensive efforts. To overcome this challenge, this paper introduces the AutoDSL framework to automate DSL-based constraint design across various domains. Utilizing domain specified experimental protocol corpora, AutoDSL optimizes syntactic constraints and abstracts semantic constraints. Quantitative and qualitative analyses of the DSLs designed by AutoDSL across five distinct domains highlight its potential as an auxiliary module for language models, aiming to improve procedural planning and execution.

This paper investigates the application of domain-specific languages in product line engineering (PLE). It starts by analyzing the limits of expressivity of feature models. Feature models correspond to context-free grammars without recursion, which prevents the expression of multiple instances and references. The authors then show how domain-specific languages (DSLs) can serve as a middle ground between feature modeling and programming. They can be used in cases where feature models are too limited, while keeping the separation between problem space and solution space provided by feature models. This work then categorizes useful combinations between configuration with feature model and construction with DSLs and provide an integration of DSLs into the conceptual framework of PLE. Finally the authors show how use of a consistent, unified formalism for models, code, and configuration can yield important benefits for managing variability and trace ability.

However, the resulting reaction networks are so vast that an exploration of all potentially accessible intermediates is computationally too demanding. This paper introduces a STEERING WHEEL to guide an otherwise unbiased automated exploration. The STEERING WHEEL algorithm is intuitive, generally applicable, and enables one to focus on specific regions of an emerging network. It also allows for guiding automated data generation in the context of mechanism exploration, catalyst design, and other chemical optimization challenges.

*   [Building an Open Representation for Biological Protocols](https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3604568) - ***ACM Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems***, 2023. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17225405546647782000)]. Laboratory protocols are critical to biological research and development, yet difficult to communicate and reproduce across projects, investigators, and organizations. While many attempts have been made to address this challenge, there is currently no available protocol representation that is unambiguous enough for precise interpretation and automation, yet simultaneously ‚Äúhuman friendly‚Äù and abstract enough to enable reuse and adaptation. The Laboratory Open Protocol language (LabOP) is a free and open protocol representation aiming to address this gap, building on a foundation of UML, Autoprotocol, Aquarium, SBOL RDF, and the Provenance Ontology. LabOP provides a linked-data representation both for protocols and for records of their execution and the resulting data, as well as a framework for exporting from LabOP for execution by either humans or laboratory automation. LabOP is currently implemented in the form of an RDF knowledge representation, specification document, and Python library, and supports execution as manual ‚Äúpaper protocols,‚Äù by Autoprotocol or by Opentrons. From this initial implementation, LabOP is being further developed as an open community effort.

### Domain Specific Language / Design Practises

*   [No Grammar to Rule Them All: A Survey of JSON-style DSLs for Visualization](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9904438) - ***IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics***, 2022. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17206818917381447796)]. There has been substantial growth in the use of JSON-based grammars, as well as other standard data serialization languages, to create visualizations. Each of these grammars serves a purpose: some focus on particular computational tasks (such as animation), some are concerned with certain chart types (such as maps), and some target specific data domains (such as ML). Despite the prominence of this interface form, there has been little detailed analysis of the characteristics of these languages. This study surveys and analyzes the design and implementation of 57 JSON-style DSLs for visualization. The authors analyze these languages supported by a collected corpus of examples for each DSL (consisting of 4395 instances) across a variety of axes organized into concerns related to domain, conceptual model, language relationships, affordances, and general practicalities. The authors identify tensions throughout these areas, such as between formal and colloquial specifications, among types of users, and within the composition of languages. Through this work, the authors seek to support language implementers by elucidating the choices, opportunities, and tradeoffs in visualization DSL design.

This work introduces a novel machine learning framework ILP-iML1515 based on Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) that performs abductive logical reasoning and actively learns from training examples. The ILP-iML1515 framework 1) allows high-throughput simulations and 2) actively selects experiments that reduce the experimental cost of learning gene functions in comparison to randomly selected experiments.

### Domain Specific Language / Design Practises

*   [How Domain Experts Use an Embedded DSL](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3622851) - ***OOPSLA'23***, 2023. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=8416124186663074528)]. Programming tools are increasingly integral to research and analysis in myriad domains, including specialized areas with no formal relation to computer science. Embedded domain-specific languages (eDSLs) have the potential to serve these programmers while placing relatively light implementation burdens on language designers. However, barriers to eDSL use reduce their practical value and adoption. This work aims to deepen the understanding of how programmers use eDSLs and identify user needs to inform future eDSL designs. The authors performed a contextual inquiry (9 participants) with domain experts using Mimi, an eDSL for climate change economics modeling. A thematic analysis identified five key themes, including: the interaction between the eDSL and the host language has significant and sometimes unexpected impacts on eDSL user experience, and users preferentially engage with domain-specific communities and code templates rather than host language resources.

This paper proposes library learning modulo theory (LLMT), a new library learning algorithm that additionally takes as input an equational theory for a given problem domain. LLMT uses e-graphs and equality saturation to compactly represent the space of programs equivalent modulo the theory, and uses a novel e-graph anti-unification technique to find common patterns in the corpus more directly and efficiently.

Compressed file size, an objective, easily obtained measure of display complexity, predicts both subjective complexity judgments and objective search performance. It is analogous to algorithmic complexity, a theoretical but impractical measure of bit string complexity. The data suggest that it may be possible to use the compressed file size measure to predict display performance in applied tasks.

### Domain Specific Language / Cognitive Foundations

*   [Communicating Natural Programs to Humans and Machines](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/hash/182aed0379591ebd1d655b2bdc152075-Abstract-Datasets_and_Benchmarks.html) - ***NeurIPS'22***, 2022. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13381039702346039142)]. While humans readily generate and interpret instructions in a general language, computer systems are shackled to a narrow domain-specific language that they can precisely execute. This makes building intelligent systems that can generalize to novel situations such as ARC difficult. Human-generated instructions are referred as ‚Äúnatural programs‚Äù. While they resemble computer programs, they are distinct in two ways: First, they contain a wide range of primitives; Second, they frequently leverage communicative strategies beyond directly executable codes.

This essay contributes a meta-scientific account of human-computer interaction (HCI) research as problem-solving. We build on the philosophy of Larry Laudan, who develops problem and solution as the foundational concepts of science. We argue that most HCI research is about three main types of problem: empirical, conceptual, and constructive.

*   [Grammar Prompting for Domain-Specific Language Generation with Large Language Models](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/hash/cd40d0d65bfebb894ccc9ea822b47fa8-Abstract-Conference.html) - ***NeurIPS'23***, 2023. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=11694070042468483715)]. Grammar prompting is a simple approach to enable LLMs to use external knowledge and domain-specific constraints expressed through a grammar in Backus--Naur Form (BNF) during in-context learning. Grammar prompting augments each demonstration example with a specialized grammar that is minimally sufficient for generating the particular output example, where the specialized grammar is a subset of the full DSL grammar. For inference, the LLM first predicts a BNF grammar given a test input, and then generates the output according to the rules of the grammar. Experiments demonstrate that grammar prompting can enable LLMs to perform competitively on a diverse set of DSL generation tasks, including semantic parsing (SMCalFlow, Overnight, GeoQuery), PDDL planning, and SMILES-based molecule generation.

A DSL aims to support software development by offering abstractions to a particular domain. It is expected that DSLs improve the maintainability of artifacts otherwise produced with general-purpose languages. However, the maintainability of the DSL artifacts and, hence, their adoption in mainstream development, is largely dependent on the usability of the language itself. Unfortunately, it is often hard to identify their usability strengths and weaknesses early, as there is no guidance on how to objectively reveal them. Usability is a multi-faceted quality characteristic, which is challenging to quantify beforehand by DSL stakeholders. There is even less support on how to quantitatively evaluate the usability of DSLs used in maintenance tasks. In this context, this paper reports a study to compare the usability of textual DSLs under the perspective of software maintenance. A usability measurement framework was developed based on the cognitive dimensions of notations. The framework was evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively using two DSLs in the context of two evolving object-oriented systems. The results suggested that the proposed metrics were useful: (1) to early identify DSL usability limitations, (2) to reveal specific DSL features favoring maintenance tasks, and (3) to successfully analyze eight critical DSL usability dimensions.

Smart contracts play a vital role in many fields. Despite being called smart, the development of smart contracts is a tedious task beyond defining a set of contractual rules. In addition to business knowledge, coding a smart contract requires strong technical knowledge in a multiplex of new and rapidly changing domain-specific languages and blockchain platforms. The goal of this paper is to assist developers in building smart contracts independently from the language or the target blockchain platform. In which, this paper presents the second-generation smart contract language iContractML 2.0. iContractML 2.0 is an extensible framework that empowers developers to model and generate functional smart contract code that can be deployed onto multiple blockchain platforms.

*   [Learning the language of viral evolution and escape](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.abd7331) - ***Science***, 2021. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs\&hl=en\&cluster=13862653184613223515)]. The ability for viruses to mutate and evade the human immune system and cause infection, called viral escape, remains an obstacle to antiviral and vaccine development. Understanding the complex rules that govern escape could inform therapeutic design. This work modeled viral escape with machine learning algorithms originally developed for human natural language. The authors identified escape mutations as those that preserve viral infectivity but cause a virus to look different to the immune system, akin to word changes that preserve a sentence‚Äôs grammaticality but change its meaning. With this approach, language models of influenza hemagglutinin, HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (HIV Env), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Spike viral proteins can accurately predict structural escape patterns using sequence data alone. This study represents a promising conceptual bridge between natural language and viral evolution.

Existing tool support focuses on the simplification of technical aspects but lacks support for an enforcement of principles for a good language design. In this paper we investigate guidelines that are useful for designing domain specific languages, largely based on our experience in developing languages as well as relying on existing guidelines on general purpose (GPLs) and modeling languages. This work defined Guidelines to support a DSL developer to achieve better quality of the language design and a better acceptance among its users.

Tactile sensing is a key sensor modality for robots interacting with their surroundings. These sensors provide a rich and diverse set of data signals that contain detailed information collected from contacts between the robot and its environment. The data are however not limited to individual contacts and can be used to extract a wide range of information about the objects in the environment as well as the actions of the robot during the interactions. This article provides an overview of tactile information and its applications in robotics. The authors present a hierarchy consisting of raw, contact, object, and action levels to structure the tactile information, with higher-level information often building upon lower-level information. The authors discuss different types of information that can be extracted at each level of the hierarchy. The article also includes an overview of different types of robot applications and the types of tactile information that they employ. Finally the article ends with a discussion for future tactile applications which are still beyond the current capabilities of robots.

Mapping molecular structure to odor perception is a key challenge in olfaction. This work used graph neural networks to generate a principal odor map (POM) that preserves perceptual relationships and enables odor quality prediction for previously uncharacterized odorants. The model was as reliable as a human in describing odor quality: On a prospective validation set of 400 out-of-sample odorants, the model-generated odor profile more closely matched the trained panel mean than did the median panelist. By applying simple, interpretable, theoretically rooted transformations, the POM outperformed chemoinformatic models on several other odor prediction tasks, indicating that the POM successfully encoded a generalized map of structure-odor relationships. This approach broadly enables odor prediction and paves the way toward digitizing odors.

Humans perceive the world using multi-modal sensory inputs such as vision, audition, and touch. This work investigates the cross-modal connection between vision and touch. The main challenge in this cross-domain modeling task lies in the significant scale discrepancy between the two: while our eyes perceive an entire visual scene at once, humans can only feel a small region of an object at any given moment. To connect vision and touch, this work introduces new tasks of synthesizing plausible tactile signals from visual inputs as well as imagining how we interact with objects given tactile data as input. To accomplish the goals, the authors first equip robots with both visual and tactile sensors and collect a large-scale dataset of corresponding vision and tactile image sequences. To close the scale gap, the authors present a new conditional adversarial model that incorporates the scale and location information of the touch. Human perceptual studies demonstrate that the model can produce realistic visual images from tactile data and vice versa.

Semantic features have been playing a central role in investigating the nature of our conceptual representations. Yet the enormous time and effort required to empirically sample and norm features from human raters has restricted their use to a limited set of manually curated concepts. Given recent promising developments with transformer-based language models, here the authors asked whether it was possible to use such models to automatically generate meaningful lists of properties for arbitrary object concepts and whether these models would produce features similar to those found in humans. To this end, the authors probed a GPT-3 model to generate semantic features for 1,854 objects and compared automatically-generated features to existing human feature norms. GPT-3 generated many more features than humans, yet showed a similar distribution in the types of generated features. Generated feature norms rivaled human norms in predicting similarity, relatedness, and category membership, while variance partitioning demonstrated that these predictions were driven by similar variance in humans and GPT-3. Together, these results highlight the potential of large language models to capture important facets of human knowledge and yield a new approach for automatically generating interpretable feature sets, thus drastically expanding the potential use of semantic features in psychological and linguistic studies.

This work presents ImageBind, an approach to learn a joint embedding across six different modalities - images, text, audio, depth, thermal, and IMU data. The authors show that all combinations of paired data are not necessary to train such a joint embedding, and only image-paired data is sufficient to bind the modalities together. ImageBind can leverage recent large scale vision-language models, and extends their zero-shot capabilities to new modalities just by using their natural pairing with images. It enables novel emergent applications 'out-of-the-box' including cross-modal retrieval, composing modalities with arithmetic, cross-modal detection and generation. The emergent capabilities improve with the strength of the image encoder and this work sets a new state-of-the-art on emergent zero-shot recognition tasks across modalities, outperforming specialist supervised models. Finally, the authors show strong few-shot recognition results outperforming prior work, and that ImageBind serves as a new way to evaluate vision models for visual and non-visual tasks.

This work examines concept generalization at a large scale in the natural visual spectrum. Established computational modes (i.e., rule-based or similarity-based) are primarily studied isolated, focusing on confined and abstract problem spaces. This work studies these two modes when the problem space scales up and when the complexity of concepts becomes diverse. At the representational level, the authors investigate how the complexity varies when a visual concept is mapped to the representation space. Prior literature has shown that two types of complexities build an inverted-U relation. Leveraging Representativeness of Attribute (RoA), the authors computationally confirm: Models use attributes with high RoA to describe visual concepts, and the description length falls in an inverted-U relation with the increment in visual complexity. At the computational level, the authors examine how the complexity of representation affects the shift between the rule- and similarity-based generalization. The authors hypothesize that category-conditioned visual modeling estimates the co-occurrence frequency between visual and categorical attributes, thus potentially serving as the prior for the natural visual world. Experimental results show that representations with relatively high subjective complexity outperform those with relatively low subjective complexity in rule-based generalization, while the trend is the opposite in similarity-based generalization.

The GOLD model (Graph Of Language Distribution) is a network model constructed based on co-occurrence in a large corpus of natural language that may be used to explore what information may be present in a graph-structured model of language, and what information may be extracted through theoretically-driven algorithms as well as standard graph analysis methods. The present study will employ GOLD to examine two types of relationship between words: semantic similarity and associative relatedness. Semantic similarity refers to the degree of overlap in meaning between words, while associative relatedness refers to the degree to which two words occur in the same schematic context. It is expected that a graph structured model of language constructed based on co-occurrence should easily capture associative relatedness, because this type of relationship is thought to be present directly in lexical co-occurrence. However, it is hypothesized that semantic similarity may be extracted from the intersection of the set of first-order connections, because two words that are semantically similar may occupy similar thematic or syntactic roles across contexts and thus would co-occur lexically with the same set of nodes. Two versions the GOLD model that differed in terms of the co-occurence window, bigGOLD at the paragraph level and smallGOLD at the adjacent word level, were directly compared to the performance of a well-established distributional model, Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). The superior performance of the GOLD models (big and small) suggest that a single acquisition and storage mechanism, namely co-occurrence, can account for associative and conceptual relationships between words and is more psychologically plausible than models using singular value decomposition (SVD).

*   [A high-level programming language for generative protein design](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.12.21.521526v1) - 2022. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=11732741354610784314)]. Combining a basic set of building blocks into more complex forms is a universal design principle. Most protein designs have proceeded from a manual bottom-up approach using parts created by nature, but top-down design of proteins is fundamentally hard due to biological complexity. This work demonstrates how the modularity and programmability long sought for protein design can be realized through generative artificial intelligence. Advanced protein language models demonstrate emergent learning of atomic resolution structure and protein design principles. The authors leverage these developments to enable the programmable design of de novo protein sequences and structures of high complexity. First, the authors describe a high-level programming language based on modular building blocks that allows a designer to easily compose a set of desired properties. The authors then develop an energy-based generative model, built on atomic resolution structure prediction with a language model, that realizes all-atom structure designs that have the programmed properties. Designing a diverse set of specifications, including constraints on atomic coordinates, secondary structure, symmetry, and multimerization, demonstrates the generality and controllability of the approach. Enumerating constraints at increasing levels of hierarchical complexity shows that the approach can access a combinatorially large design space.

*   [Explanation and Abductive Inference](https://cognition.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/cognition/files/explanation_abductive_inference.pdf) - ***The Oxford Handbook of Thinking and Reasoning***, 2012. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=16126850654692681562)]. This chapter reviews evidence from cognitive psychology and cognitive development concerning the structure and function of explanations, with a focus on the role of explanations in learning and inference. The findings highlight the value of understanding explanation and abductive inference both as phenomena in their own right and for the insights they provide concerning foundational aspects of human cognition, such as representation, learning, and inference.
*   [The structure and function of explanations](https://cognition.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/cognition/files/tics_explanation.pdf) - ***Trends in Cognitive Sciences***, 2006. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2849189270394400667)]. Generating and evaluating explanations is spontaneous, ubiquitous and fundamental to our sense of understanding. Recent evidence suggests that in the course of an individual's reasoning, engaging in explanation can have profound effects on the probability assigned to causal claims, on how properties are generalized and on learning. These effects follow from two properties of the structure of explanations: explanations accommodate novel information in the context of prior beliefs, and do so in a way that fosters generalization.
*   [Explanatory Preferences Shape Learning and Inference](https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/cognition/files/explanatory_prefs_tics.pdf) - ***Trends in Cognitive Sciences***, 2016. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2040551538203889465)]. People often learn by seeking explanations, and they assess the viability of hypotheses by considering how well they explain the data. An emerging body of work reveals that both children and adults have strong and systematic intuitions about what constitutes a good explanation, and that these explanatory preferences have a systematic impact on explanation-based processes. In particular, people favor explanations that are simple and broad, with the consequence that engaging in explanation can shape learning and inference by leading people to seek patterns and favor hypotheses that support broad and simple explanations.
*   [Explanation, updating, and accuracy](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/20445911.2016.1230122) - ***Journal of Cognitive Psychology***, 2016. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=967127146748155733)]. There is evidence that people update their credences partly on the basis of explanatory considerations. Philosophers have recently argued that to minimise the inaccuracy of their credences, people's updates also ought to be partly based on such considerations. However, there are many ways in which explanatory considerations can factor into updating, not all of which minimise inaccuracy. It is an open question whether in their updating, people take explanatory considerations into account in a way that philosophers would deem recommendable. To address this question, the authors re-analyse data from an experiment reported in Douven and Schupbach, ‚ÄúThe role of explanatory considerations in updating‚Äù.

There is a wealth of evidence that people‚Äôs reasoning is influenced by explanatory considerations. Three experiments investigate the descriptive adequacy of a precise proposal to be found in the philosophical literature, to wit, that we should infer to the best explanation, provided certain additional conditions are met. The main conslusions are that (a) the quality of an explanation is a good predictor of people‚Äôs willingness to accept that explanation, and a better predictor than the prior probability of the explanation, and (b) if more than one possible explanation is given, people are the less willing to infer the best explanation the better they deem the second-best explanation.

The book is divided into four parts. Part I introduces the subject of discovery, defines the scope of our work, and discusses some of the issues that have surrounded and still surround our topic. Parts II and III contain the main body of our results, largely in the form of accounts of the performance of computer programs that simulate human thought processes to make scientific discoveries. Part II is devoted largely to the processes for inducing quantitative theories from data. Part III is devoted mainly to the processes for inducing qualitative descriptive and structural theories from data. In Part IV, on the basis of our experience, we discuss at a lower level of precision how the programs described in the preceding chapters could be combined into a single, more general discovery system, and we describe a wide range of the other component processes that enter into scientific discovery.

This paper describes a cognitive model of exploratory learning, which covers both trial-and-error and instruction-taking activities. The model, implemented in Soar, is grounded in empirical data of subjects in a task-oriented, trial-and-error exploratory learning situation. A key empirical finding reflected in the model is the repeated scanning of a subset of the available menu items, with increased attention to items on each successive scan. This is explained in terms of dual search spaces, the external interface and the user's internal knowledge, both of which must be tentatively explored with attention to changing costs and benefits.

When evaluating experimental evidence, how do people deal with the possibility that some of the feedback is erroneous? The potential for error means that evidence evaluation must include decisions about when to ‚Äútrust the data.‚Äù This paper presents two studies that focus on subjects‚Äô responses to erroneous feedback in a hypothesis testing situation‚Äîa variant of Wason‚Äôs (1960) 2‚Äì4‚Äì6 rule discovery task in which some feedback was subject tosystem error: ‚Äúhits‚Äù were reported as ‚Äúmisses‚Äù and vice versa. Results show that, in contrast to previous research, people are equally adept at identifying false negatives and false positives; further, successful subjects were less likely to use a positive test strategy (Klayman & Ha, 1987) than were unsuccessful subjects. Finally, although others have found that generating possible hypotheses prior to experimentation increases success and task efficiency, such a manipulation did little to mitigate the effects of system error.

### Abduction / Rationalization

*   [Imagination and the generation of new ideas](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0885201414000744) - ***Cognitive Development***, 2015. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=16920774374067505248)]. A variety of theories have been put forth to explain the function of imagination, most notably that imagination engages and develops children's theory of mind and counterfactual reasoning. This work proposes that a primary role for imagination is as a cognitive mechanism for efficiently generating new ideas without observing new evidence. Learners must generate hypotheses before they can assess the truth of these hypotheses. Given infinite possibilities, how do learners constrain the process of hypothesis generation? The authors suggest that learners represent abstract criteria for the solution to a problem and generate solutions that, if true, would solve the problem. As a preliminary test of this idea, the authors show that, in the absence of any fact of the matter (i.e., when neither prior knowledge nor statistical data distinguishes competing hypotheses), 4‚Äì6-year-olds (mean: 63 months) systematically converge on solutions to problems, consistent with an ability to imagine the abstract properties of causal problems and their solutions.
*   [How We Know What Not To Think](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661319302311) - ***Trends in Cognitive Sciences***, 2019. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13106919756521743226)]. Humans often represent and reason about unrealized possible actions---the vast infinity of things that were not (or have not yet been) chosen. This capacity is central to the most impressive of human abilities: causal reasoning, planning, linguistic communication, moral judgment, etc. Nevertheless, how do we select possible actions that are worth considering from the infinity of unrealized actions that are better left ignored? This work reviews research across the cognitive sciences, and find that the possible actions considered by default are those that are both likely to occur and generally valuable. This paper then offers a unified theory of why. The authors propose that (i) across diverse cognitive tasks, the possible actions we consider are biased towards those of general practical utility, and (ii) a plausible primary function for this mechanism resides in decision making.
*   [Rationalization is rational](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/abs/rationalization-is-rational/2A13B99ED09BD802C0924D3681FEC55B) - ***Behavioral and Brain Sciences***, 2020. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5165464589274056844)]. \[[Preprint](https://bpb-us-e1.wpmucdn.com/websites.harvard.edu/dist/0/59/files/2022/03/rationalization_is_rational.pdf)]. Rationalization occurs when a person has performed an action and then concocts the beliefs and desires that would have made it rational. Then, people often adjust their own beliefs and desires to match the concocted ones. While many studies demonstrate rationalization, and a few theories describe its underlying cognitive mechanisms, we have little understanding of its function. Why is the mind designed to construct post hoc rationalizations of its behavior, and then to adopt them? This may accomplish an important task: transferring information between the different kinds of processes and representations that influence our behavior. Human decision making does not rely on a single process; it is influenced by reason, habit, instinct, norms, and so on. Several of these influences are not organized according to rational choice (i.e., computing and maximizing expected value). Rationalization extracts implicit information ‚Äì true beliefs and useful desires ‚Äì from the influence of these non-rational systems on behavior.
*   [Why Imaginary Worlds? The psychological foundations and cultural evolution of fictions with imaginary worlds](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/abs/why-imaginary-worlds/CA2AB4B1E1EDD8FE965E6DDB4A047B35) - ***Behavioral and Brain Sciences***, 2021. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=16985691366494688837)]. Imaginary worlds are extremely successful. The most popular fictions produced in the last few decades contain such a fictional world. They can be found in all fictional media, from novels (e.g., Lord of The Rings and Harry Potter) to films (e.g., Star Wars and Avatar), video games (e.g., The Legend of Zelda and Final Fantasy), graphic novels (e.g., One Piece and Naruto), and TV series (e.g., Star Trek and Game of Thrones), and they date as far back as ancient literature (e.g., the Cyclops Islands in The Odyssey, 850 BCE). Why such a success? Why so much attention devoted to non-existent worlds? In this paper, the authors propose that imaginary worlds co-opt our preferences for exploration, which have evolved in humans and nonhuman animals alike, to propel individuals toward new environments and new sources of reward. Humans would find imaginary worlds very attractive for the very same reasons, and under the same circumstances, as they are lured by unfamiliar environments in real life. After reviewing research on exploratory preferences in behavioral ecology, environmental esthetics, neuroscience, and evolutionary and developmental psychology, the authors focus on the sources of their variability across time and space, which they argue can account for the variability of the cultural preference for imaginary worlds. This hypothesis can, therefore, explain the way imaginary worlds evolved culturally, their shape and content, their recent striking success, and their distribution across time and populations.

### Abduction / Applications in AI

*   [Functional genomic hypothesis generation and experimentation by a robot scientist](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature02236) - ***Nature***, 2004. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17461972625475533182)]. This paper describes a physically implemented robotic system that applies techniques from artificial intelligence to carry out cycles of scientific experimentation. The system automatically originates hypotheses to explain observations, devises experiments to test these hypotheses, physically runs the experiments using a laboratory robot, interprets the results to falsify hypotheses inconsistent with the data, and then repeats the cycle.

*   [Interpretation as abduction](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0004370293900154?via%3Dihub) - ***Artificial Intelligence***, 1993. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12658433318211361322)]. Abduction is inference to the best explanation. The authors have developed an approach to abductive inference, called ‚Äúweighted abduction‚Äù, that has resulted in a significant simplification of how the problem of interpreting texts is conceptualized. The interpretation of a text is the minimal explanation of why the text would be true. More precisely, to interpret a text, one must prove the logical form of the text from what is already mutually known, allowing for coercions, merging redundancies where possible, and making assumptions where necessary. It is shown how such ‚Äúlocal pragmatics‚Äù problems as reference resolution, the interpretation of compound nominals, the resolution of syntactic ambiguity and metonymy, and schema recognition can be solved in this manner. Moreover, this approach of ‚Äúinterpretation as abduction‚Äù can be combined with the older view of ‚Äúparsing as deduction‚Äù to produce an elegant and thorough integration of syntax, semantics, and pragmatics, one that spans the range of linguistic phenomena from phonology to discourse structure.
*   [Probabilistic Horn abduction and Bayesian networks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/000437029390061F?via%3Dihub) - ***Artificial Intelligence***, 1993. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7728248035489349629)]. This paper presents a simple framework for Horn-clause abduction, with probabilities associated with hypotheses. The framework incorporates assumptions about the rule base and independence assumptions amongst hypotheses. It is shown how any probabilistic knowledge representable in a discrete Bayesian belief network can be represented in this framework. The main contribution is in finding a relationship between logical and probabilistic notions of evidential reasoning. This provides a useful representation language in its own right, providing a compromise between heuristic and epistemic adequacy.

This paper presents the framework of Abductive Constraint Logic Programming (ACLP), which integrates Abductive Logic Programming (ALP) and Constraint Logic Programming (CLP). In ACLP, the task of abduction is supported and enhanced by its non-trivial integration with constraint solving. This integration of constraint solving into abductive reasoning facilitates a general form of constructive abduction and enables the application of abduction to computationally demanding problems. The paper studies the formal declarative and operational semantics of the ACLP framework together with its application to various problems.
*   [Machine Translation Using Abductive Inference](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/H91-1024.pdf) - ***COLING***, 1990. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=15275163177548183539)]. Many existing approaches to machine translation take for granted that the information presented in the output is found somewhere in the input, and, moreover, that such information should be expressed at a single representational level, say, in terms of the parse trees or of "semantic" assertions. Languages, however, not only express the equivalent information by drastically different linguistic means, but also often disagree in what distinctions should be expressed linguistically at all. For example, in translating from Japanese to English, it is often necessary to supply determiners for noun phrases, and this in general cannot be done without deep understanding of the source text. Similarly, in translating from English to Japanese, politeness considerations, which in English are implicit in the social situation and explicit in very diffuse ways in, for example, the heavy use of hypotheticals, must be realized grammatically in Japanese. Machine translation therefore requires that the appropriate inferences be drawn and that the text be interpreted to some depth. Recently, an elegant approach to inference in discourse interpretation has been developed at a number of sites, all based on the notion of abduction, and the authors have begun to explore its potential application to machine translation. The authors argue that this approach provides the possibility of deep reasoning and of mapping between the languages at a variety of levels.

The authors show that a generative random field model, which they call generative ConvNet, can be derived from the commonly used discriminative ConvNet, by assuming a ConvNet for multi-category classification and assuming one of the category is a base category generated by a reference distribution. For a further assumption that the non-linearity in the ConvNet is Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) and the reference distribution is Gaussian white noise, then a generative ConvNet model that is unique among energy-based models is obtained: The model is piecewise Gaussian, and the means of the Gaussian pieces are defined by an auto-encoder, where the filters in the bottom-up encoding become the basis functions in the top-down decoding, and the binary activation variables detected by the filters in the bottom-up convolution process become the coefficients of the basis functions in the top-down deconvolution process.

A first step in identifying the content of a document is determining which topics that document addresses. This paper describes a generative model for documents, in which each document is generated by choosing a distribution over topics and then choosing each word in the document from a topic selected according to this distribution. The authors then present a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for inference in this model. The authors use this algorithm to analyze abstracts from PNAS by using Bayesian model selection to establish the number of topics. This work shows that the extracted topics capture meaningful structure in the data, consistent with the class designations provided by the authors of the articles, and outline further applications of this analysis, including identifying ‚Äúhot topics‚Äù by examining temporal dynamics and tagging abstracts to illustrate semantic content.

The Indian buffet process is a stochastic process defining a probability distribution over equivalence classes of sparse binary matrices with a finite number of rows and an unbounded number of columns. This distribution is suitable for use as a prior in probabilistic models that represent objects using a potentially infinite array of features, or that involve bipartite graphs in which the size of at least one class of nodes is unknown. This work gives a detailed derivation of this distribution, and illustrate its use as a prior in an infinite latent feature model. The authors then review recent applications of the Indian buffet process in machine learning, discuss its extensions, and summarize its connections to other stochastic processes.

This work proposes statistical predicate invention as a key problem for statistical relational learning. SPI is the problem of discovering new concepts, properties and relations in structured data, and generalizes hidden variable discovery in statistical models and predicate invention in ILP. This work proposes an initial model for SPI based on second-order Markov logic, in which predicates as well as arguments can be variables, and the domain of discourse is not fully known in advance. The proposed approach iteratively refines clusters of symbols based on the clusters of symbols they appear in atoms with (e.g., it clusters relations by the clusters of the objects they relate).

### Bayesian Modeling / Bayesian Optimization

*   [A Tutorial on Bayesian Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02811) - 2018. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7971934771645047583)]. Bayesian optimization is an approach to optimizing objective functions that take a long time (minutes or hours) to evaluate. It is best-suited for optimization over continuous domains of less than 20 dimensions, and tolerates stochastic noise in function evaluations. It builds a surrogate for the objective and quantifies the uncertainty in that surrogate using a Bayesian machine learning technique, Gaussian process regression, and then uses an acquisition function defined from this surrogate to decide where to sample. This tutorial describes how Bayesian optimization works, including Gaussian process regression and three common acquisition functions: expected improvement, entropy search, and knowledge gradient. The authors then discuss more advanced techniques, including running multiple function evaluations in parallel, multi-fidelity and multi-information source optimization, expensive-to-evaluate constraints, random environmental conditions, multi-task Bayesian optimization, and the inclusion of derivative information. The authors conclude with a discussion of Bayesian optimization software and future research directions in the field. This tutorial provides a generalization of expected improvement to noisy evaluations, beyond the noise-free setting where it is more commonly applied. This generalization is justified by a formal decision-theoretic argument, standing in contrast to previous ad hoc modifications.

Understanding language requires more than the use of fixed conventions and more than decoding combinatorial structure. Instead, comprehenders make exquisitely sensitive inferences about what utterances mean given their knowledge of the speaker, language, and context. Building on developments in game theory and probabilistic modeling, the authors describe the rational speech act (RSA) framework for pragmatic reasoning. RSA models provide a principled way to formalize inferences about meaning in context; they have been used to make successful quantitative predictions about human behavior in a variety of different tasks and situations, and they explain why complex phenomena, such as hyperbole and vagueness, occur. More generally, they provide a computational framework for integrating linguistic structure, world knowledge, and context in pragmatic language understanding.

This is a discussion of some of the achievements and challenges related to representing actions and the design of planners from the perspective of logic programming. The authors talk about recent work on action languages and translating them into logic programming, on representing possible histories of an action domain by answer sets, on efficient implementations of the answer set semantics and their use for generating plans, and on causal logic and its relation to planning algorithms. Recent progress in these areas may lead to the creation of planners which are based on the ideas of logic programming and combine the use of expressive action description languages with efficient computational procedures.

This book presents, within a conceptually unified theoretical framework, a body of methods that have been developed over the past fifteen years for building and simulating qualitative models of physical systems - bathtubs, tea kettles, automobiles, the physiology of the body, chemical processing plants, control systems, electrical systems - where knowledge of that system is incomplete. The primary tool for this work is the author's QSIM algorithm, which is discussed in detail. Qualitative models are better able than traditional models to express states of incomplete knowledge about continuous mechanisms. Qualitative simulation guarantees to find all possible behaviors consistent with the knowledge in the model. This expressive power and coverage is important in problem solving for diagnosis, design, monitoring, explanation, and other applications of artificial intelligence.

Many animals, and an increasing number of artificial agents, display sophisticated capabilities to perceive and manipulate objects. But human beings remain distinctive in their capacity for flexible, creative tool use‚Äîusing objects in new ways to act on the world, achieve a goal, or solve a problem. To study this type of general physical problem solving, this work introduces the Virtual Tools game. In this game, people solve a large range of challenging physical puzzles in just a handful of attempts. This work proposes that the flexibility of human physical problem solving rests on an ability to imagine the effects of hypothesized actions, while the efficiency of human search arises from rich action priors which are updated via observations of the world. The authors instantiate these components in the ‚Äúsample, simulate, update‚Äù (SSUP) model and show that it captures human performance across 30 levels of the Virtual Tools game. More broadly, this model provides a mechanism for explaining how people condense general physical knowledge into actionable, task-specific plans to achieve flexible and efficient physical problem solving.

The original paper on Inverse Planning, a computational implementation of Theory of Mind. Humans are adept at inferring the mental states underlying other agents‚Äô actions, such as goals, beliefs, desires, emotions and other thoughts. This paper proposes a computational framework based on Bayesian inverse planning for modeling human action understanding. The framework represents an intuitive theory of intentional agents‚Äô behavior based on the principle of rationality: the expectation that agents will plan approximately rationally to achieve their goals, given their beliefs about the world. The mental states that caused an agent's behavior are inferred by inverting this model of rational planning using Bayesian inference, integrating the likelihood of the observed actions with the prior over mental states.

Experimental games model situations in which the future outcomes of individuals and groups depend on their own choices and on those of other (groups of) individuals. Games are a powerful tool to identify the neural and psychological mechanisms underlying interpersonal and group cooperation and coordination.

Towards the goal of building machine-learning algorithms with human-like social intelligence, this paper develops a generative model of multiagent action understanding based on a novel representation for these latent relationships called Composable Team Hierarchies (CTH). This representation is grounded in the formalism of stochastic games and multi-agent reinforcement learning. This work uses CTH as a target for Bayesian inference yielding a new algorithm for understanding behavior in groups that can both infer hidden relationships as well as predict future actions for multiple agents interacting together.

### Abduction / Rationalization

*   [Rationalizing constraints on the capacity for cognitive control](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661321001480) - ***Trends in Cognitive Sciences***, 2021. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13060297961922073063)]. Humans are remarkably limited in: (i) how many control-dependent tasks they can execute simultaneously, and (ii) how intensely they can focus on a single task. These limitations are universal assumptions of most theories of cognition. Yet, a rationale for why humans are subject to these constraints remains elusive. This feature review draws on recent insights from psychology, neuroscience, and machine learning, to suggest that constraints on cognitive control may result from a rational adaptation to fundamental, computational dilemmas in neural architectures. The reviewed literature implies that limitations in multitasking may result from a trade-off between learning efficacy and processing efficiency and that limitations in the intensity of commitment to a single task may reflect a trade-off between cognitive stability and flexibility.

Shortcomings of qualitative simulation and of quantitative simulation motivate combining them to do simulations exhibiting strengths of both. The resulting class of techniques is called semiquantitative simulation. One approach to semi-quantitative simulation is to use numeric intervals to represent incomplete quantitative information. This research demonstrates semi-quantitative simulation using intervals in an implemented semi-quantitative simulator called Q3. Q3 progressively refines a qualitative simulation, providing increasingly specific quantitative predictions which can converge to a numerical simulation in the limit while retaining important correctness guarantees from qualitative and interval simulation techniques.

Most philosophers of science in the twentieth century have concluded that no logic of creative processes exists and, moreover, that a rational model of discovery is impossible. In short, scientific creative inferences are irrational and there is no ‚Äúreasoning‚Äù to hypotheses. On the other hand, some research in the area of artificial intelligence has shown that methods for discovery could be found that are computationally adequate for rediscovering --- or discovering for the first time --- empirical or theoretical laws and theorems.

In this book, D. Klahr sets out to describe the cognitive and developmental processes that have enabled scientists to make the discoveries that comprise the body of information we call "scientific knowledge." Over the past decade, Klahr and his colleagues have conducted laboratory experiments in which they create discovery contexts, computer-based environments, to evoke the kind of thinking characteristic of scientific discovery in the "real world." In attempting to solve the problems posed by the discovery tasks, experiment participants (from preschoolers to university students) use many of the same higher-order cognitive processes used by practicing scientists. Through his work, Klahr integrates two disparate approaches‚Äìthe content-based approach and the process-based approach‚Äì to present a comprehensive model of the psychology of scientific discovery.

### Abduction / Applications in AI

*   [Abductive Inference in Bayesian Networks: A Review](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-39879-0_6) - ***Advances in Bayesian Networks***, 2004. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=8502276402734843212)]. The goal of this paper is to serve as a survey for the problem of abductive inference (or belief revision) in Bayesian networks. Thus, the problem is introduced in its two variants: total abduction (or MPE) and partial abduction (or MAP) . Also, the problem is formulated in its general case, that is, looking for the K best explanations. Then, a (non exhaustive) review of exact and approximate algorithms for dealing with both abductive inference problems is carried out. Finally, the authors collect the main complexity results appeared in the literature for both problems (MPE and MAP).
*   [Abductive Plan Recognition by Extending Bayesian Logic Programs](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~ml/papers/raghavan.ecml11.pdf) - ***ECML'11***, 2011. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7276511797197017483)]. Plan recognition is the task of predicting an agent‚Äôs top-level plans based on its observed actions. It is an abductive reasoning task that involves inferring cause from effect. Most existing approaches to plan recognition use either first-order logic or probabilistic graphical models. While the former cannot handle uncertainty, the latter cannot handle structured representations. In order to overcome these limitations, this work develops an approach to plan recognition using Bayesian Logic Programs (BLPs), which combine first-order logic and Bayesian networks. Since BLPs employ logical deduction to construct the networks, they cannot be used effectively for plan recognition. Therefore, the authors extend BLPs to use logical abduction to construct Bayesian networks and call the resulting model Bayesian Abductive Logic Programs (BALPs). The authors learn the parameters in BALPs using the Expectation Maximization algorithm adapted for BLPs.

Abduction has been extensively studied in propositional logic because of its many applications in artificial intelligence. However, its intrinsic complexity has been a limitation to the implementation of abductive reasoning tools in more expressive logics. The authors have devised such a tool in ground flat equational logic, in which literals are equations or disequations between constants. The tool is based on the computation of prime implicates. It uses a relaxed paramodulation calculus, designed to generate all prime implicates of a formula, together with a carefully defined data structure storing the implicates and able to efficiently detect, and remove, redundancies.
*   [Abduction-Based Explanations for Machine Learning Models](https://ojs.aaai.org//index.php/AAAI/article/view/3964) - ***AAAI'19***, 2019. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7355960657107994022)]. The growing range of applications of Machine Learning (ML) in a multitude of settings motivates the ability of computing small explanations for predictions made. Small explanations are generally accepted as easier for human decision makers to understand. Most earlier work on computing explanations is based on heuristic approaches, providing no guarantees of quality, in terms of how close such solutions are from cardinality- or subset-minimal explanations. This paper develops a constraint-agnostic solution for computing explanations for any ML model. The proposed solution exploits abductive reasoning, and imposes the requirement that the ML model can be represented as sets of constraints using some target constraint reasoning system for which the decision problem can be answered with some oracle. The experimental results, obtained on well-known datasets, validate the scalability of the proposed approach as well as the quality of the computed solutions.

Before formal education begins, children typically acquire a vocabulary of thousands of words. This learning process requires the use of many different information sources in their social environment, including their current state of knowledge and the context in which they hear words used. This paper specifies a developmental model according to which children consider information sources in an age-specific way and integrate them via Bayesian inference. This work presents a developmental theory of information integration during language learning and illustrates how formal models can be used to make a quantitative test of the predictive and explanatory power of competing theories.

This paper presents a model of core mentalizing computations: inferring jointly an actor‚Äôs beliefs, desires and percepts from how they move in the local spatial environment. The proposed Bayesian theory of mind (BToM) model is based on probabilistically inverting artificial-intelligence approaches to rational planning and state estimation, which extend classical expected-utility agent models to sequential actions in complex, partially observable domains.

This paper reviews the idea that Theory of Mind --- humans' ability to reason about other people's mental states --- can be formalized as inverse reinforcement learning. Under this framework, expectations about how mental states produce behavior are captured in a reinforcement learning (RL) model. Predicting other people‚Äôs actions is achieved by simulating a RL model with the hypothesized beliefs and desires, while mental-state inference is achieved by inverting this model. Although many advances in inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) did not have human Theory of Mind in mind, this paper focuses on what they reveal when conceptualized as cognitive theories.

This paper proposes an intuitive theory framework to studying affective cognition‚Äîhow humans reason about emotions‚Äîand derive a taxonomy of inferences within affective cognition. Using this taxonomy, the authors review formal computational modeling work on such inferences, including causal reasoning about how others react to events, reasoning about unseen causes of emotions, reasoning with multiple cues, as well as reasoning from emotions to other mental states. This framework proposes unifying these various types of reasoning as Bayesian inference within a common ‚Äúintuitive Theory of Emotion.‚Äù

This paper presents a formal theory of the Na√Øve Utility Calculus as a probabilistic generative model, which highlights the role of cost and reward tradeoffs in a Bayesian framework for action-understanding. The model predicts with quantitative accuracy how people infer agents‚Äô subjective costs and rewards based on their observable actions. By distinguishing between desires, goals, and intentions, the model extends to complex action scenarios unfolding over space and time in scenes with multiple objects and multiple action episodes.
