> Welcome to **Awesome Golem**, a community-curated list of resources, links, projects, tools and applications on Golem!

The users of Golem run the reference implementation in the form of the Rust implementation, Yagna. Together the users make up the Golem Network, a P2P marketplace for computational resources where individuals can act as one of the two non-exclusive roles; a provider selling idle resources, or a requestor buying resources to run tasks.
