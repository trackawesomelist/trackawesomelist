## Overview

**An up-to-date, community-driven list of awesome European tech alternatives!  all focused on privacy, sustainability, and innovation. The goal is to support European projects and companies (compliant with GDPR, UK GDPR, and the Swiss FADP), helping to strengthen the European tech ecosystem.**

European software and companies often adhere to unique standards that provide significant benefits to users. These standards not only enhance user experience but also set a global benchmark for innovation, privacy, and sustainability. For example:

*   **GDPR Compliance**: European companies are required to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which ensures stricter data privacy and security for users compared to many other regions, including the U.S. This regulation has become a global gold standard for data protection.

*   **Sustainability Standards**: Many European companies prioritize eco-friendly practices, such as utilizing renewable energy, reducing carbon emissions, and adopting circular economy principles. These efforts align with the EU’s ambitious Green Deal initiatives, making them leaders in sustainable innovation.

***

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  **Compliance**: Must adhere to GDPR, UK GDPR, Swiss FADP, or other relevant European data protection frameworks.
2.  **European Headquarters**: The company or project must be based in Europe.
3.  **Technology Focus** Must be a company or project that leverages technology as a core component of its operations, products, or services.
