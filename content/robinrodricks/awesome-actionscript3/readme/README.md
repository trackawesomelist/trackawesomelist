# Awesome ActionScript 3 [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

> A curated list of awesome libraries and components for ActionScript 3 and Adobe AIR.

[Adobe AIR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_AIR) provides a single set of APIs to build cross-platform desktop/mobile applications and games. [ActionScript 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActionScript) is the programming language for AIR. Powerful native functionality such as file system, SQLite, sensors are included by default. To add missing functionality, you can build ANEs (Air Native Extensions) coded in the native language (eg VC++ for Windows, Java for Android, Swift/Objective-C for iOS). To build mobile apps/games with GPU-rendered graphics, use the [Starling](https://gamua.com/starling/) framework and optionally the [Feathers UI](https://feathersui.com/). Adobe AIR is very popular in the mobile gaming space.
