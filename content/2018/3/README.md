### Messaging

*   [BitMessage](https://bitmessage.org/wiki/Main_Page) is a P2P communications protocol used to send encrypted messages to another person or to many subscribers. It is decentralized and trustless, meaning that you need-not inherently trust any entities like root certificate authorities. See [whitepaper](https://bitmessage.org/bitmessage.pdf).
*   [Cables communication](http://dee.su/cables) implements secure and anonymous communication using email-like addresses, pioneered in Libert√© Linux. Cables communication is Libert√©'s pivotal component for enabling anyone to communicate safely and covertly in hostile environments.
*   [Mailpile](http://www.mailpile.is/) is free software, a web-mail program that you run on your own computer, so your data stays under your control. Because it is free software (a.k.a. open source), you can look under the hood and see how it works, or even modify it to make it better suit your particular needs. Mailpile is designed for speed and vast amounts of e-mail, it is flexible and themeable and has support for strong encryption built in from the very start.
*   [Matrix](http://matrix.org/) is an open standard for decentralised communication, providing simple HTTP APIs and open source reference implementations for securely distributing and persisting JSON over an open federation of servers. You can use Matrix for any project where you need a common data fabric to link together fragmented silos of communication.

### Protocols

*   [Webmentions](http://indiewebcamp.com/webmention) are an interesting method of notify another site that a *comment* /post on your own site is written in response to a post on their site. The site receiving the webmention notification can then verify the request and gather the message adding into a conversation flow in their post.[This project (‚≠ê43)](http://github.com/glennjones/webmentions) is working on a unified API.

Users share not only static files but dynamic objects too. Code is taken as equivalent to contracts ("smart contracts") and hosts check each others compliance.
*   [BaseParadigm](https://bitbucket.org/travisfw/baseparadigm/) is an open source (GPLv3) library for managing a content addressable binary  semantic graph. Content addressability means enabling a number of dataexchange protocols (including p2p) for a developer using BaseParadigm.
*   [BitTorrent Sync](http://www.bittorrent.com/sync) by BitTorrent Labs. Easy and effortless file replication between computers (and mobile devices) without using the cloud, so the only limit is available storage. All data transfers are encrypted. Works on Windows, Linux, OSX, Android and iOS. Recently they've [opened up their API](http://www.bittorrent.com/sync/developers/api) to developers.
*   [bitlove-ui](http://bitlove.org/) Bitlove creates Torrents for all enclosures of an RSS/ATOM feed and seeds them for podcasts.

*   [Firestr (‚≠ê358)](http://github.com/mempko/firestr) is a simple decentralized communication and computation platform. Apps are written in Lua and are pushed to peers where they automatically run and connect. All communication is P2P and encrypted.
*   [Freedom Box](http://freedomboxfoundation.org/) is about privacy, control, ease of use and dehierarchicalization. Inspired by Eben Moglen's vision of a small, cheap and simple computer that serves freedom in the home. We are building a Debian based platform for distributed applications.
*   [Freenet](http://freenetproject.org) is free software which lets you anonymously share files, browse and publish "freesites" (web sites accessible only through Freenet) and chat on forums, without fear of censorship. Freenet is decentralised to make it less vulnerable to attack, and if used in "darknet" mode, where users only connect to their friends, is very difficult to detect.
