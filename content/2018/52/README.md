- ☆: ★★★

  Name: [Vim](https://www.vim.org/download.php)

  Platform: CLI / Cross-Platform

  Description: Vim is one of the most popular text editors among advanced programmers. It allows text-editing to be done very efficiently with solely keystrokes. Vim is also highly configurable, extensible and integrates with shells (command lines) really well. The only setback about Vim is that it has a high learning curve for beginners.


- ☆: ★★★

  Platform: CLI / Cross-Platform

  Description: Emacs is another popular text editor (or development environment to be more precise). The debate on "Vim vs. Emacs" is constantly brought up due to their popularity. Basically Emacs is more than just a text editor. It has plugins like file managers, web browsers, mail clients and news clients that allows users to performs these tasks directly inside Emacs. Emacs is "heavier" because of this, but it arguably has a relatively easier learning curve for beginners.

- ☆: ★★☆

  Name: [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)

  Platform: GUI / Cross-Platform
