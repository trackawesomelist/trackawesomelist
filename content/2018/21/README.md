    *   This course picks up where Harvard College‚Äôs [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/) leaves off, focusing on the development of 2D and 3D interactive games. Students explore the design of such childhood games as Super Mario Bros., Legend of Zelda, and Portal in a quest to understand how video games themselves are implemented. Via lectures and hands-on projects, the course explores principles of 2D and 3D graphics, animation, sound, and collision detection using frameworks like Unity and [L√ñVE 2D](https://love2d.org/), as well as languages like Lua and C#. By class‚Äôs end, students will have programmed several of their own games and gained a thorough understanding of the basics of game design and development.
