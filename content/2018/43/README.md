    *   This course develops techniques used in the design and analysis of algorithms, with an emphasis on problems arising in computing applications. Example applications are drawn from systems and networks, artificial intelligence, computer vision, data mining, and computational biology. This course covers four major algorithm design techniques (greedy algorithms, divide and conquer, dynamic programming, and network flow), computability theory focusing on undecidability, computational complexity focusing on NP-completeness, and algorithmic techniques for intractable problems, including identification of structured special cases, approximation algorithms, and local search heuristics.

    *   This graduate course gives a broad introduction to complexity theory, including classical results and recent developments. Complexity theory aims to understand the power of efficient computation (when computational resources like time and space are limited). Many compelling conceptual questions arise in this context. Most of these questions are (surprisingly?) difficult and far from being resolved. Nevertheless, a lot of progress has been made toward understanding them (and also why they are difficult). We will learn about these advances in this course. A theme will be combinatorial constructions with random-like properties, e.g., expander graphs and error-correcting codes. Some examples:
        *   Is finding a solution inherently more difficult than verifying it?
        *   Do more computational resources mean more computing power?
        *   Is it easier to find approximate solutions than exact ones?
        *   Are randomized algorithms more powerful than deterministic ones?
        *   Is it easier to solve problems in the average case than in the worst case?
        *   Are quantum computers more powerful than classical ones?

### Courses / Misc

    *   Hardware that exploits quantum phenomena can dramatically alter the nature of computation. Though constructing a working quantum computer is a formidable technological challenge, there has been much recent experimental progress. In addition, the theory of quantum computation is of interest in itself, offering strikingly different perspectives on the nature of computation and information, as well as providing novel insights into the conceptual puzzles posed by the quantum theory. The course is intended both for physicists, unfamiliar with computational complexity theory or cryptography, and also for computer scientists and mathematicians, unfamiliar with quantum mechanics. The prerequisites are familiarity (and comfort) with finite dimensional vector spaces over the complex numbers, some standard group theory, and ability to count in binary.

### Strategy

### [Game of Thrones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Game_of_Thrones_\(board_game\))

> A Game of Thrones allows the players to take on the roles of several of the Great Houses vying for control of the Seven Kingdoms, including House Stark, House Lannister, House Baratheon, House Greyjoy, House Tyrell, and as of the expansion A Clash of Kings, House Martell. Players maneuver armies to secure support in the various regions that comprise the Seven Kingdoms, with the goal of capturing enough support to claim the Iron Throne. The basic gameplay mechanics are reminiscent of Diplomacy, especially in the order-giving process, though A Game of Thrones is significantly more complicated overall.

![Game of thrones boardgame image](https://cf.geekdo-images.com/M_7UvwZvuxBVjxdadsa5AA__itemrep/img/ZdvVWyy_BWv4QMZ7x1bxYGU0DE0=/fit-in/246x300/filters:strip_icc\(\)/pic1077906.jpg)

### [YINSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YINSH)

> Players start with five rings on the board. First player to remove 3 rings becomes the winner. Every time a ring is moved, it leaves a marker behind. Markers are white on one side and black on the other, and each time they are jumped they must be flipped. Once a player forms a row of 5 markers of their color, they can remove a ring. The challenge is each row you make brings you closer to victory-but also makes you weaker, because you have one fewer ring to play with.

### [Cthulhu Wars](https://petersengames.com/cthulhu-wars/)

> Cthulhu Wars is a fast-moving strategy game about the end of the world. You take the part of various monstrous aliens seeking to dominate the world. You can play as Great Cthulhu himself, or you can take charge of other factions, such as the slithering hordes of the Crawling Chaos, or the insane minions of the Yellow Sign.

### [Anachrony](https://mindclashgames.com/game-worlds/anachrony/)

> Anachrony is a competitive Euro-style strategy game set in a post-apocalyptic world rebuilt along four different ideological Paths. The game is played through a series of turns called Eras, with past ones reachable through time travel later in the game. Players assume the roles of iconic leaders of the four Paths, striving not only for the supremacy and well-being of their people, but also their survival. After the fourth Era, an asteroid impact shakes Earth, threatening to destroy the World Capital, Earth‚Äôs last independent city. The Paths should prepare for the coming cataclysm, and when the time comes, take their part in evacuating the collapsing Capital. In the end, one of the Paths will be the new home to the reformed World Council, and lead humanity into a new future.

### [Clockwork Wars](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/139952/clockwork-wars)

> In Clockwork Wars each player commands a unique race of creatures in a tense war game set in a fantasy-steampunk universe. Take control of the calculating Purebreeds, the industrious Troglodytes, the mighty Rhinochs, or the proud Mongrels. Your goal is to vanquish your foes and accumulate the most victory points through nine turns of play. You earn points by fighting for control of territories that contain valuable natural resources. To win these battles, you need manpower gained by seizing villages and developing them into cities. Invest in research and discover astonishing new technologies, position your troops, research powerful discoveries, employ espionage, and conquer your enemies to win the game!
