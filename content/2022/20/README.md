The course will study a range of topics at this interface. The only prerequisite to the course is mathematical thinking.
*   [Chekuri. Topics in Algorithms: Algorithmic Game Theory](https://chekuri.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/spring2008/agt.htm) - A broad graduate-level introduction to: auctions, existence and computation of equilibria in games and markets, algorithmic mechanism design, price of anarchy and price of stability, games relevant to networks and e-commerce. The emphasis will be on conceptual ideas and algorithmic aspects. No familiarity with game theory or economics will be assumed.
*   [Penna. Algorithmic Game Theory](https://ml2.inf.ethz.ch/courses/agt/) - The course discusses algorithmic aspects of game theory, such as a general introduction to game theory, auctions, mechanisms, the costs of a central control optimum versus those of an equilibrium under selfish agents, and algorithms and complexity of computing equilibria.

Traditionally this has been JavaScript but more recently there has been the trend to use C#/WASM with Blazor. These modern applications typically also need authentication and single-sign-on as well as token-based security for calling APIs ‚Äì in other words OpenID Connect and OAuth 2. There are different patterns for securing such applications and this session covers some of the pitfalls of the various approaches, especially given the ever-changing browser landscape. We will conclude with the ‚Äúbackend for frontend‚Äù (or BFF) pattern which has become the most secure and stable of these approaches.
