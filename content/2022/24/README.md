### Videos / Others

*   [Displaying Custom Reports in Blazor using Syncfusion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CA8waGMYHbY) - ![duration](https://img.shields.io/badge/Duration:%20-50%20min-%230094FF?style=flat-square\&cacheSeconds=maxAge\&logo=youtube) May 20, 2022 - In the last video, we created a custom report using the Bold Reports Designer. We could use the provided Bold Reports Viewer to display the reports, but that does not always fit with what you want to accomplish. That is why today we will implement a report viewer in a Blazor Server application. That way, we can show our custom report to our clients directly inside of our site instead of sending them to a separate application.
*   [Creating Office Files in Blazor using Syncfusion - PDF, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyoCxzRLUsQ) - ![duration](https://img.shields.io/badge/Duration:%20-19%20min-%230094FF?style=flat-square\&cacheSeconds=maxAge\&logo=youtube) May 13, 2022 - Creating office files in C# has always been a popular solution. You can generate reports in formats that users are comfortable with. With the Syncfusion file controls, you can not only create Excel files, you can also create Microsoft Word documents, PowerPoint presentations, and PDF documents. In this video, we will look at the office file controls in Syncfusion and how to use them.
*   [Intro to Blazor Controls in Syncfusion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ9S9rt-rKc) - ![duration](https://img.shields.io/badge/Duration:%20-42%20min-%230094FF?style=flat-square\&cacheSeconds=maxAge\&logo=youtube) May 11, 2022 - The Blazor controls in Syncfusion are pretty impressive. In this video, we will look at the DataGrid, charts, a Kanban-style board, a dashboard, autocomplete textboxes, context menus, signature pads, menu bars, toast messages, and more. There are so many controls to look at, in fact, that we are going to purposefully ignore the office file creation and display controls, as well as reporting. That way, we can spend more time on the other controls today and then focus on the office files in another video. The reporting will actually have two different videos dedicated to it.
*   [Intro to SignalR in C# Part 1 - using Blazor, WPF, best practices, and more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaXx_f3bIRU) - ![duration](https://img.shields.io/badge/Duration:%20-72%20min-%230094FF?style=flat-square\&cacheSeconds=maxAge\&logo=youtube) April 25, 2022 - SignalR is an excellent way to connect two or more clients together for real-time communication. The best part is that this library is just a wrapper around web-standard technologies such as Web Sockets and Long-Polling. It just makes them easier to use. That means we can even use SignalR with other clients such as Java or JavaScript. In this video, we are going to learn how to set up SignalR and how to connect to it using web clients and desktop clients. Throughout the video, we will cover best practices, as well as how to use this in the real world.
