### Family

### [Sagrada](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/199561/sagrada)

> Each player builds a stained glass window by building up a grid of dice on their player board. Each board has some restrictions on which color or shade (value) of die can be placed there. Dice of the same shade or color may never be placed next to each other. Dice are drafted in player order, with the start player rotating each round, snaking back around after the last player drafts two dice. Scoring is variable per game based on achieving various patterns and varieties of placement...as well as bonus points for dark shades of a particular hidden goal color.

### Frontends

*   **Luma** (`Magento/luma`) - This is actually a default demo theme of Magento 2 itself, which again extends from `Magento/blank` which extends from the core. But more often, the name Luma refers to the entire stack: XML layout generates a tree-structure of blocks and containers, which eventually render via PHTML templates. The server-side rendered HTML is enriched with CSS (compiled from LESS source files) and JavaScript (RequireJS, KnockoutJS, jQuery).
*   **Adobe PWA Studio** - A new headless frontend, created by Adobe/Magento, based on ReactJS. It makes GraphQL calls to the Magento GraphQL API to retrieve data. The frontend offers Venia (a demo theme and UI component library), Peregrine (React hooks), Buildpack (Webpack configuration) and UPWARD (a middleware for SSR and image optimization).
*   **Hyvä** ([hyva.io](https://hyva.io/)) - An alternative for Luma, which replaces the LESS/CSS with TailwindCSS and the JavaScript with AlpineJS. Currently, it is only available via a commercial license. But for that price, the team works hard to create compatibility modules for 3rd party modules, give support and make the entire solution more and more versatile.
