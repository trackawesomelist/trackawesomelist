We’ll take you on a tour of the tools and frameworks that can speed up your development time to create powerful, native desktop and mobile apps for Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android from a single codebase with .NET MAUI. We’ll also show you how to enhance your Blazor web apps with native device capabilities.
*   [Future Possibilities for .NET Core and WASI (WebAssembly on the Server)](https://mybuild.microsoft.com/en-US/sessions/ddf48da7-d3e6-4ba5-affd-b5735ce205fa?source=sessions) - ![duration](https://img.shields.io/badge/Duration:%20-28%20min-%230094FF?style=flat-square\&cacheSeconds=maxAge\&logo=microsoft) May 25, 2022 - WebAssembly is moving beyond the browser and is pitched to become a foundational element of modern cloud-native architecture. It lets any language compile to universal binaries that run on any OS or processor, robustly sandboxed and with great performance. This session covers a new approach to running .NET in WASI environments. You’ll see how your existing .NET code could be built into WASI-compliant modules, plus the opportunities this opens. This is experimental, not yet a committed product.
*   [Learn .NET MAUI - Full Course for Beginners | Tutorial for iOS, Android, Mac, Windows in C#](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuNLR_NJv8U) - May 23, 2022 - Let's start our journey together to build beautiful native cross-platform apps for iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows with [.NET MAUI](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/maui), C#, and Visual Studio! In this full workshop, I will walk you through everything you need to know about [.NET MAUI](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/maui) and building your very first app. You will learn the basics including how to build user interfaces with XAML, how MVVM and data binding simplify development, how to navigate between pages, access platform features like geolocation, optimize data collections, and theme your app for light theme and dark theme. This course has everything you need to learn the basics and set you up for success when building apps with [.NET MAUI](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/maui).
*   [Bringing WebAssembly to the .NET Mainstream - Steve Sanderson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIeYw7kJUIg) - ![duration](https://img.shields.io/badge/Duration:%20-30%20min-%230094FF?style=flat-square\&cacheSeconds=maxAge\&logo=youtube) May 19, 2022 - Many developers still consider WebAssembly to be a leading-edge, niche technology tied to low-level systems programming languages. However, C# and .NET have run on WebAssembly since 2017. Blazor WebAssembly brought .NET into the browser on open standards, and is now one of the fastest-growing parts of .NET across enterprises, startups, and hobbyists. Next, with WASI we could let you run .NET in even more places, introducing cloud-native tools and techniques to a wider segment of the global developer community. This is a technical talk showing how we bring .NET to WebAssembly. Steve will demonstrate how it runs both interpreted and AOT-compiled, how an IDE debugger can attach, performance tradeoffs, and how a move from Emscripten to WASI SDK lets it run in Wasmtime/Wasmer or higher-level runtimes like wasmCloud. Secondly, you'll hear lessons learned from Blazor as an open-source project - challenges and misconceptions faced bringing WebAssembly beyond early adopters.
