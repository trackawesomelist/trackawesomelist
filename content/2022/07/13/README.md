Working with Blazor WebAssembly applications we often overlook the importance of appropriate state management. Without a good understanding and the right strategy, our applications can end up polluted with components that behave badly and we end up regretting the bad choices.- This session covers the simple state management flavours and then progress towards something more tasty like the Redux pattern. We will see what there is to like and dislike about each flavour. Next, we will take a step back and determine the appropriate seasoning of state management to pair with our application. You will leave this session having sampled all the wonderful flavours and be able to make great decisions to have the best development experience.
