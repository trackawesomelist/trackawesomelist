## [11. Awesome Agi Cocosci](/content/YuzheSHI/awesome-agi-cocosci/README.md)

### Abduction / Explanation

*   [Abduction](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/abduction/index.html) - ***Plato Stanford***. A computational philosophy account on Abduction, one of the three thinking patterns besides Induction and Deduction, being unique for its potential to introduce new ideas into current knowledge.
*   [Scientific Explanation](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-explanation/) - ***Plato Stanford***. A computational philosophy account on Scientific Explanation, a canonical application of Abduction.
*   [Scientific Reduction](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-reduction/) - ***Plato Stanford***. A computational philosophy account on Scientific Reduction, which comes with no explicit boundary with Explanation.
*   [Non-monotonic Logic](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-nonmonotonic/) - ***Plato Stanford***. A computational philosophy account on Non-monotonic Logic, a family of formal frameworks devised to capture and represent defeasible inference.
*   [Philosophical Writings of Peirce](https://4lib.org/book/702071/e8ffe8) - ***Courier Corporation***, 1955. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3917019015464129592)]. Original writings by C. S. Peirce, the philosopher who first introduces the concept of Abduction.
*   [Abductive Reasoning and Learning](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-94-017-1733-5) - ***Springer***, 2000. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12074269365138058159)]. This book contains leading survey papers on the various aspects of Abduction, both logical and numerical approaches.
*   [Explanation and Abductive Inference](https://cognition.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/cognition/files/explanation_abductive_inference.pdf) - ***The Oxford Handbook of Thinking and Reasoning***, 2012. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=16126850654692681562)]. This chapter reviews evidence from cognitive psychology and cognitive development concerning the structure and function of explanations, with a focus on the role of explanations in learning and inference. The findings highlight the value of understanding explanation and abductive inference both as phenomena in their own right and for the insights they provide concerning foundational aspects of human cognition, such as representation, learning, and inference.
*   [The structure and function of explanations](https://cognition.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/cognition/files/tics_explanation.pdf) - ***Trends in Cognitive Sciences***, 2006. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2849189270394400667)]. Generating and evaluating explanations is spontaneous, ubiquitous and fundamental to our sense of understanding. Recent evidence suggests that in the course of an individual's reasoning, engaging in explanation can have profound effects on the probability assigned to causal claims, on how properties are generalized and on learning. These effects follow from two properties of the structure of explanations: explanations accommodate novel information in the context of prior beliefs, and do so in a way that fosters generalization.
*   [Explanatory Preferences Shape Learning and Inference](https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/cognition/files/explanatory_prefs_tics.pdf) - ***Trends in Cognitive Sciences***, 2016. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2040551538203889465)]. People often learn by seeking explanations, and they assess the viability of hypotheses by considering how well they explain the data. An emerging body of work reveals that both children and adults have strong and systematic intuitions about what constitutes a good explanation, and that these explanatory preferences have a systematic impact on explanation-based processes. In particular, people favor explanations that are simple and broad, with the consequence that engaging in explanation can shape learning and inference by leading people to seek patterns and favor hypotheses that support broad and simple explanations.
*   [Explanation, updating, and accuracy](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/20445911.2016.1230122) - ***Journal of Cognitive Psychology***, 2016. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=967127146748155733)]. There is evidence that people update their credences partly on the basis of explanatory considerations. Philosophers have recently argued that to minimise the inaccuracy of their credences, people's updates also ought to be partly based on such considerations. However, there are many ways in which explanatory considerations can factor into updating, not all of which minimise inaccuracy. It is an open question whether in their updating, people take explanatory considerations into account in a way that philosophers would deem recommendable. To address this question, the authors re-analyse data from an experiment reported in Douven and Schupbach, “The role of explanatory considerations in updating”.
*   [Best, second-best, and good-enough explanations: How they matter to reasoning](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-03972-001) - ***Journal of Experimental Psychology***, 2018. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3067550385175104201)]. There is a wealth of evidence that people’s reasoning is influenced by explanatory considerations. Three experiments investigate the descriptive adequacy of a precise proposal to be found in the philosophical literature, to wit, that we should infer to the best explanation, provided certain additional conditions are met. The main conslusions are that (a) the quality of an explanation is a good predictor of people’s willingness to accept that explanation, and a better predictor than the prior probability of the explanation, and (b) if more than one possible explanation is given, people are the less willing to infer the best explanation the better they deem the second-best explanation.
*   [How explanation guides belief change](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661321001790) - ***Trends in Cognitive Sciences***, 2021. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=15240531165875981526)]. Philosophers have argued that people ought to change their graded beliefs via Bayes’ rule. Recent work in psychology indicates that people sometimes violate that rule by attending to explanatory factors. Results from computational modeling suggest that such violations may actually be rational.
*   [Patterns of abduction](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-007-9223-4) - ***Synthese***, 2007. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=15230540023076470385\&hl=en\&as_sdt=0,5)]. A categorization for Abduction in the account of pure philosophy.

*   [Probabilistic alternatives to Bayesianism: the case of explanationism](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00459/full) - ***Frontiers in Psychology***, 2015. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9016714668469830914\&hl=en\&as_sdt=0,5)]. A non-Bayesian account of Abduction.

A rational account of human hypothesis generation.
*   [Explanation-seeking curiosity in childhood](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352154620300851) - ***Current Opinion in Behavioral Sciences***, 2020. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4167956555501133663\&hl=en\&as_sdt=2005)]. A piece of developmental pshchological evidence for Abduction in young children.

### Abduction / Scientific Discovery

*   [Scientific Discovery](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-discovery/) - ***Plato Stanford***. A computational philosophy account on Scientific Discovery, the process or product of successful scientific inquiry, sometimes an Abduction-like (Explanation) thinking pattern.
*   [Models of Discovery: And Other Topics in the Methods of Science](https://hk1lib.org/book/2241843/c5d7b3?id=2241843\&secret=c5d7b3) - ***Springer***, 1977. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9932701864897299105\&hl=en\&as_sdt=0,5)]. The original book on search as scientific thinking.
*   [Scientific discovery: Computational explorations of the creative processes](https://hk1lib.org/book/970300/6b0ff7?id=970300\&secret=6b0ff7) - ***MIT Press***, 1987. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=11327000316248254911)]. The book is divided into four parts. Part I introduces the subject of discovery, defines the scope of our work, and discusses some of the issues that have surrounded and still surround our topic. Parts II and III contain the main body of our results, largely in the form of accounts of the performance of computer programs that simulate human thought processes to make scientific discoveries. Part II is devoted largely to the processes for inducing quantitative theories from data. Part III is devoted mainly to the processes for inducing qualitative descriptive and structural theories from data. In Part IV, on the basis of our experience, we discuss at a lower level of precision how the programs described in the preceding chapters could be combined into a single, more general discovery system, and we describe a wide range of the other component processes that enter into scientific discovery.
*   [Dual Space Search During Scientific Reasoning](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15516709cog1201_1) - ***Cognitive Science***, 1988. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17542852673494089523\&hl=en\&as_sdt=2005\&sciodt=0,5)]. The original paper on the dual space search as scientific thinking theory.
*   [Complexity Management in a Discovery Task](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/psychology/pdf/klahr/PDFs/schunn-klahr.pdf) - ***CogSci'92***, 1992. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=18138712608977258974\&hl=en\&as_sdt=2005\&sciodt=0,5)]. Advanced experiments on dual space search.
*   [A dual-space model of iteratively deepening exploratory learning](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1071581996900324) - ***International Journal of Human-Computer Studies***, 1996. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17337189265334825678)]. This paper describes a cognitive model of exploratory learning, which covers both trial-and-error and instruction-taking activities. The model, implemented in Soar, is grounded in empirical data of subjects in a task-oriented, trial-and-error exploratory learning situation. A key empirical finding reflected in the model is the repeated scanning of a subset of the available menu items, with increased attention to items on each successive scan. This is explained in terms of dual search spaces, the external interface and the user's internal knowledge, both of which must be tentatively explored with attention to changing costs and benefits.

Rationalization occurs when a person has performed an action and then concocts the beliefs and desires that would have made it rational. Then, people often adjust their own beliefs and desires to match the concocted ones. While many studies demonstrate rationalization, and a few theories describe its underlying cognitive mechanisms, we have little understanding of its function. Why is the mind designed to construct post hoc rationalizations of its behavior, and then to adopt them? This may accomplish an important task: transferring information between the different kinds of processes and representations that influence our behavior. Human decision making does not rely on a single process; it is influenced by reason, habit, instinct, norms, and so on. Several of these influences are not organized according to rational choice (i.e., computing and maximizing expected value). Rationalization extracts implicit information – true beliefs and useful desires – from the influence of these non-rational systems on behavior.

### Abduction / Applications in AI

*   [Functional genomic hypothesis generation and experimentation by a robot scientist](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature02236) - ***Nature***, 2004. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17461972625475533182)]. This paper describes a physically implemented robotic system that applies techniques from artificial intelligence to carry out cycles of scientific experimentation. The system automatically originates hypotheses to explain observations, devises experiments to test these hypotheses, physically runs the experiments using a laboratory robot, interprets the results to falsify hypotheses inconsistent with the data, and then repeats the cycle. The system is applied to the determination of gene function using deletion mutants of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and auxotrophic growth experiments. The authors built and tested a detailed logical model (involving genes, proteins and metabolites) of the aromatic amino acid synthesis pathway.
*   [Interpretation as abduction](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0004370293900154?via%3Dihub) - ***Artificial Intelligence***, 1993. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12658433318211361322)]. Abduction is inference to the best explanation. The authors have developed an approach to abductive inference, called “weighted abduction”, that has resulted in a significant simplification of how the problem of interpreting texts is conceptualized. The interpretation of a text is the minimal explanation of why the text would be true. More precisely, to interpret a text, one must prove the logical form of the text from what is already mutually known, allowing for coercions, merging redundancies where possible, and making assumptions where necessary. It is shown how such “local pragmatics” problems as reference resolution, the interpretation of compound nominals, the resolution of syntactic ambiguity and metonymy, and schema recognition can be solved in this manner. Moreover, this approach of “interpretation as abduction” can be combined with the older view of “parsing as deduction” to produce an elegant and thorough integration of syntax, semantics, and pragmatics, one that spans the range of linguistic phenomena from phonology to discourse structure.

This paper presents a simple framework for Horn-clause abduction, with probabilities associated with hypotheses. The framework incorporates assumptions about the rule base and independence assumptions amongst hypotheses. It is shown how any probabilistic knowledge representable in a discrete Bayesian belief network can be represented in this framework. The main contribution is in finding a relationship between logical and probabilistic notions of evidential reasoning. This provides a useful representation language in its own right, providing a compromise between heuristic and epistemic adequacy.

This paper presents the framework of Abductive Constraint Logic Programming (ACLP), which integrates Abductive Logic Programming (ALP) and Constraint Logic Programming (CLP). In ACLP, the task of abduction is supported and enhanced by its non-trivial integration with constraint solving. This integration of constraint solving into abductive reasoning facilitates a general form of constructive abduction and enables the application of abduction to computationally demanding problems. The paper studies the formal declarative and operational semantics of the ACLP framework together with its application to various problems.

Understanding language requires more than the use of fixed conventions and more than decoding combinatorial structure. Instead, comprehenders make exquisitely sensitive inferences about what utterances mean given their knowledge of the speaker, language, and context. Building on developments in game theory and probabilistic modeling, the authors describe the rational speech act (RSA) framework for pragmatic reasoning. RSA models provide a principled way to formalize inferences about meaning in context; they have been used to make successful quantitative predictions about human behavior in a variety of different tasks and situations, and they explain why complex phenomena, such as hyperbole and vagueness, occur. More generally, they provide a computational framework for integrating linguistic structure, world knowledge, and context in pragmatic language understanding.
