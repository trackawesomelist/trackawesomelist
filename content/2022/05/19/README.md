*   [Tim Roughgarden. Complexity Theory, Game Theory, and Economics: The Barbados Lectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00734) - A mini-course notes of two-fold goals: mini-course is twofold: (i) Explain how complexity theory has helped illuminate several barriers in economics and game theory; and (ii) Illustrate how game-theoretic questions have led to new and interesting complexity theory, including recent several breakthroughs.
*   [Eva Tardos. Algorithmic Game Theory](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6840/2012sp/) - It combines algorithmic thinking with game-theoretic, or, more generally, economic concepts. The course will study a range of topics at this interface. The only prerequisite to the course is mathematical thinking.
*   [Chekuri. Topics in Algorithms: Algorithmic Game Theory](https://chekuri.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/spring2008/agt.htm) - A broad graduate-level introduction to: auctions, existence and computation of equilibria in games and markets, algorithmic mechanism design, price of anarchy and price of stability, games relevant to networks and e-commerce. The emphasis will be on conceptual ideas and algorithmic aspects. No familiarity with game theory or economics will be assumed.
*   [Penna. Algorithmic Game Theory](https://ml2.inf.ethz.ch/courses/agt/) - The course discusses algorithmic aspects of game theory, such as a general introduction to game theory, auctions, mechanisms, the costs of a central control optimum versus those of an equilibrium under selfish agents, and algorithms and complexity of computing equilibria.
