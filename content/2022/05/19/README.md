*   [Tim Roughgarden. Complexity Theory, Game Theory, and Economics: The Barbados Lectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00734) - A mini-course notes of two-fold goals: mini-course is twofold: (i) Explain how complexity theory has helped illuminate several barriers in economics and game theory; and (ii) Illustrate how game-theoretic questions have led to new and interesting complexity theory, including recent several breakthroughs.
*   [Eva Tardos. Algorithmic Game Theory](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6840/2012sp/) - It combines algorithmic thinking with game-theoretic, or, more generally, economic concepts. The course will study a range of topics at this interface. The only prerequisite to the course is mathematical thinking.

Topics in Algorithms: Algorithmic Game Theory](https://chekuri.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/spring2008/agt.htm) - A broad graduate-level introduction to: auctions, existence and computation of equilibria in games and markets, algorithmic mechanism design, price of anarchy and price of stability, games relevant to networks and e-commerce. The emphasis will be on conceptual ideas and algorithmic aspects. No familiarity with game theory or economics will be assumed.
*   [Penna. Algorithmic Game Theory](https://ml2.inf.ethz.ch/courses/agt/) - The course discusses algorithmic aspects of game theory, such as a general introduction to game theory, auctions, mechanisms, the costs of a central control optimum versus those of an equilibrium under selfish agents, and algorithms and complexity of computing equilibria.

The computational point of view, on the other hand, is essential to understand a world in which markets are networked and the default platforms of economic transactions are algorithmic.
