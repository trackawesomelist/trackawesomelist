Real-world software projects often involve combining many technologies. So, is modern Blazor powerful and flexible enough for your team's needs? In this demo-heavy talk, Steve will show how Blazor WebAssembly/Server can seamlessly embed libraries and logic written in other languages such as Rust or C/C++, how Blazor WebAssembly/Server components can be used inside other SPA frameworks such as React or Angular (or vice-versa) and how Blazor components can be used not only for web projects, but also shared with native apps for macOS, iOS, Android, and Windows (including WPF and WinForms) These capabilities should equip your team to take on the most ambitious projects with confidence. We'll then look further into the future and consider how WebAssembly is moving beyond the browser and is pitched to become a foundational element of cloud-native server apps. You'll be among the first to see an experimental new approach to compiling .NET applications into WASI-compliant universal binaries that can run on any OS or processor, robustly sandboxed and with great performance.

*   [Abductive Reasoning and Learning](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-94-017-1733-5) - ***Springer***, 2000. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12074269365138058159)]. This book contains leading survey papers on the various aspects of Abduction, both logical and numerical approaches.
*   [Explanation and Abductive Inference](https://cognition.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/cognition/files/explanation_abductive_inference.pdf) - ***The Oxford Handbook of Thinking and Reasoning***, 2012. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=16126850654692681562)]. This chapter reviews evidence from cognitive psychology and cognitive development concerning the structure and function of explanations, with a focus on the role of explanations in learning and inference. The findings highlight the value of understanding explanation and abductive inference both as phenomena in their own right and for the insights they provide concerning foundational aspects of human cognition, such as representation, learning, and inference.
*   [The structure and function of explanations](https://cognition.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/cognition/files/tics_explanation.pdf) - ***Trends in Cognitive Sciences***, 2006. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2849189270394400667)]. Generating and evaluating explanations is spontaneous, ubiquitous and fundamental to our sense of understanding. Recent evidence suggests that in the course of an individual's reasoning, engaging in explanation can have profound effects on the probability assigned to causal claims, on how properties are generalized and on learning. These effects follow from two properties of the structure of explanations: explanations accommodate novel information in the context of prior beliefs, and do so in a way that fosters generalization.
*   [Explanatory Preferences Shape Learning and Inference](https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/cognition/files/explanatory_prefs_tics.pdf) - ***Trends in Cognitive Sciences***, 2016. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2040551538203889465)]. People often learn by seeking explanations, and they assess the viability of hypotheses by considering how well they explain the data. An emerging body of work reveals that both children and adults have strong and systematic intuitions about what constitutes a good explanation, and that these explanatory preferences have a systematic impact on explanation-based processes. In particular, people favor explanations that are simple and broad, with the consequence that engaging in explanation can shape learning and inference by leading people to seek patterns and favor hypotheses that support broad and simple explanations.
*   [Explanation, updating, and accuracy](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/20445911.2016.1230122) - ***Journal of Cognitive Psychology***, 2016. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=967127146748155733)]. There is evidence that people update their credences partly on the basis of explanatory considerations. Philosophers have recently argued that to minimise the inaccuracy of their credences, people's updates also ought to be partly based on such considerations. However, there are many ways in which explanatory considerations can factor into updating, not all of which minimise inaccuracy. It is an open question whether in their updating, people take explanatory considerations into account in a way that philosophers would deem recommendable. To address this question, the authors re-analyse data from an experiment reported in Douven and Schupbach, ‚ÄúThe role of explanatory considerations in updating‚Äù.
*   [Best, second-best, and good-enough explanations: How they matter to reasoning](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-03972-001) - ***Journal of Experimental Psychology***, 2018. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3067550385175104201)]. There is a wealth of evidence that people‚Äôs reasoning is influenced by explanatory considerations. Three experiments investigate the descriptive adequacy of a precise proposal to be found in the philosophical literature, to wit, that we should infer to the best explanation, provided certain additional conditions are met. The main conslusions are that (a) the quality of an explanation is a good predictor of people‚Äôs willingness to accept that explanation, and a better predictor than the prior probability of the explanation, and (b) if more than one possible explanation is given, people are the less willing to infer the best explanation the better they deem the second-best explanation.
*   [How explanation guides belief change](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661321001790) - ***Trends in Cognitive Sciences***, 2021. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=15240531165875981526)]. Philosophers have argued that people ought to change their graded beliefs via Bayes‚Äô rule. Recent work in psychology indicates that people sometimes violate that rule by attending to explanatory factors. Results from computational modeling suggest that such violations may actually be rational.

The book is divided into four parts. Part I introduces the subject of discovery, defines the scope of our work, and discusses some of the issues that have surrounded and still surround our topic. Parts II and III contain the main body of our results, largely in the form of accounts of the performance of computer programs that simulate human thought processes to make scientific discoveries. Part II is devoted largely to the processes for inducing quantitative theories from data. Part III is devoted mainly to the processes for inducing qualitative descriptive and structural theories from data. In Part IV, on the basis of our experience, we discuss at a lower level of precision how the programs described in the preceding chapters could be combined into a single, more general discovery system, and we describe a wide range of the other component processes that enter into scientific discovery.

This paper describes a cognitive model of exploratory learning, which covers both trial-and-error and instruction-taking activities. The model, implemented in Soar, is grounded in empirical data of subjects in a task-oriented, trial-and-error exploratory learning situation. A key empirical finding reflected in the model is the repeated scanning of a subset of the available menu items, with increased attention to items on each successive scan. This is explained in terms of dual search spaces, the external interface and the user's internal knowledge, both of which must be tentatively explored with attention to changing costs and benefits.

Rationalization occurs when a person has performed an action and then concocts the beliefs and desires that would have made it rational. Then, people often adjust their own beliefs and desires to match the concocted ones. While many studies demonstrate rationalization, and a few theories describe its underlying cognitive mechanisms, we have little understanding of its function. Why is the mind designed to construct post hoc rationalizations of its behavior, and then to adopt them? This may accomplish an important task: transferring information between the different kinds of processes and representations that influence our behavior. Human decision making does not rely on a single process; it is influenced by reason, habit, instinct, norms, and so on. Several of these influences are not organized according to rational choice (i.e., computing and maximizing expected value). Rationalization extracts implicit information ‚Äì true beliefs and useful desires ‚Äì from the influence of these non-rational systems on behavior.

### Abduction / Applications in AI

*   [Functional genomic hypothesis generation and experimentation by a robot scientist](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature02236) - ***Nature***, 2004. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17461972625475533182)]. This paper describes a physically implemented robotic system that applies techniques from artificial intelligence to carry out cycles of scientific experimentation. The system automatically originates hypotheses to explain observations, devises experiments to test these hypotheses, physically runs the experiments using a laboratory robot, interprets the results to falsify hypotheses inconsistent with the data, and then repeats the cycle. The system is applied to the determination of gene function using deletion mutants of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and auxotrophic growth experiments. The authors built and tested a detailed logical model (involving genes, proteins and metabolites) of the aromatic amino acid synthesis pathway.
*   [Interpretation as abduction](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0004370293900154?via%3Dihub) - ***Artificial Intelligence***, 1993. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12658433318211361322)]. Abduction is inference to the best explanation. The authors have developed an approach to abductive inference, called ‚Äúweighted abduction‚Äù, that has resulted in a significant simplification of how the problem of interpreting texts is conceptualized. The interpretation of a text is the minimal explanation of why the text would be true. More precisely, to interpret a text, one must prove the logical form of the text from what is already mutually known, allowing for coercions, merging redundancies where possible, and making assumptions where necessary. It is shown how such ‚Äúlocal pragmatics‚Äù problems as reference resolution, the interpretation of compound nominals, the resolution of syntactic ambiguity and metonymy, and schema recognition can be solved in this manner. Moreover, this approach of ‚Äúinterpretation as abduction‚Äù can be combined with the older view of ‚Äúparsing as deduction‚Äù to produce an elegant and thorough integration of syntax, semantics, and pragmatics, one that spans the range of linguistic phenomena from phonology to discourse structure.
*   [Probabilistic Horn abduction and Bayesian networks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/000437029390061F?via%3Dihub) - ***Artificial Intelligence***, 1993. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7728248035489349629)]. This paper presents a simple framework for Horn-clause abduction, with probabilities associated with hypotheses. The framework incorporates assumptions about the rule base and independence assumptions amongst hypotheses. It is shown how any probabilistic knowledge representable in a discrete Bayesian belief network can be represented in this framework. The main contribution is in finding a relationship between logical and probabilistic notions of evidential reasoning. This provides a useful representation language in its own right, providing a compromise between heuristic and epistemic adequacy.

This paper presents the framework of Abductive Constraint Logic Programming (ACLP), which integrates Abductive Logic Programming (ALP) and Constraint Logic Programming (CLP). In ACLP, the task of abduction is supported and enhanced by its non-trivial integration with constraint solving. This integration of constraint solving into abductive reasoning facilitates a general form of constructive abduction and enables the application of abduction to computationally demanding problems. The paper studies the formal declarative and operational semantics of the ACLP framework together with its application to various problems.

The authors show that a generative random field model, which they call generative ConvNet, can be derived from the commonly used discriminative ConvNet, by assuming a ConvNet for multi-category classification and assuming one of the category is a base category generated by a reference distribution. For a further assumption that the non-linearity in the ConvNet is Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) and the reference distribution is Gaussian white noise, then a generative ConvNet model that is unique among energy-based models is obtained: The model is piecewise Gaussian, and the means of the Gaussian pieces are defined by an auto-encoder, where the filters in the bottom-up encoding become the basis functions in the top-down decoding, and the binary activation variables detected by the filters in the bottom-up convolution process become the coefficients of the basis functions in the top-down deconvolution process.

A first step in identifying the content of a document is determining which topics that document addresses. This paper describes a generative model for documents, in which each document is generated by choosing a distribution over topics and then choosing each word in the document from a topic selected according to this distribution. The authors then present a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for inference in this model. The authors use this algorithm to analyze abstracts from PNAS by using Bayesian model selection to establish the number of topics. This work shows that the extracted topics capture meaningful structure in the data, consistent with the class designations provided by the authors of the articles, and outline further applications of this analysis, including identifying ‚Äúhot topics‚Äù by examining temporal dynamics and tagging abstracts to illustrate semantic content.

The Indian buffet process is a stochastic process defining a probability distribution over equivalence classes of sparse binary matrices with a finite number of rows and an unbounded number of columns. This distribution is suitable for use as a prior in probabilistic models that represent objects using a potentially infinite array of features, or that involve bipartite graphs in which the size of at least one class of nodes is unknown. This work gives a detailed derivation of this distribution, and illustrate its use as a prior in an infinite latent feature model. The authors then review recent applications of the Indian buffet process in machine learning, discuss its extensions, and summarize its connections to other stochastic processes.

This work proposes statistical predicate invention as a key problem for statistical relational learning. SPI is the problem of discovering new concepts, properties and relations in structured data, and generalizes hidden variable discovery in statistical models and predicate invention in ILP. This work proposes an initial model for SPI based on second-order Markov logic, in which predicates as well as arguments can be variables, and the domain of discourse is not fully known in advance. The proposed approach iteratively refines clusters of symbols based on the clusters of symbols they appear in atoms with (e.g., it clusters relations by the clusters of the objects they relate).

### Bayesian Modeling / Bayesian Optimization

*   [A Tutorial on Bayesian Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02811) - 2018. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7971934771645047583)]. Bayesian optimization is an approach to optimizing objective functions that take a long time (minutes or hours) to evaluate. It is best-suited for optimization over continuous domains of less than 20 dimensions, and tolerates stochastic noise in function evaluations. It builds a surrogate for the objective and quantifies the uncertainty in that surrogate using a Bayesian machine learning technique, Gaussian process regression, and then uses an acquisition function defined from this surrogate to decide where to sample. This tutorial describes how Bayesian optimization works, including Gaussian process regression and three common acquisition functions: expected improvement, entropy search, and knowledge gradient. The authors then discuss more advanced techniques, including running multiple function evaluations in parallel, multi-fidelity and multi-information source optimization, expensive-to-evaluate constraints, random environmental conditions, multi-task Bayesian optimization, and the inclusion of derivative information. The authors conclude with a discussion of Bayesian optimization software and future research directions in the field. This tutorial provides a generalization of expected improvement to noisy evaluations, beyond the noise-free setting where it is more commonly applied. This generalization is justified by a formal decision-theoretic argument, standing in contrast to previous ad hoc modifications.

Understanding language requires more than the use of fixed conventions and more than decoding combinatorial structure. Instead, comprehenders make exquisitely sensitive inferences about what utterances mean given their knowledge of the speaker, language, and context. Building on developments in game theory and probabilistic modeling, the authors describe the rational speech act (RSA) framework for pragmatic reasoning. RSA models provide a principled way to formalize inferences about meaning in context; they have been used to make successful quantitative predictions about human behavior in a variety of different tasks and situations, and they explain why complex phenomena, such as hyperbole and vagueness, occur. More generally, they provide a computational framework for integrating linguistic structure, world knowledge, and context in pragmatic language understanding.

This is a discussion of some of the achievements and challenges related to representing actions and the design of planners from the perspective of logic programming. The authors talk about recent work on action languages and translating them into logic programming, on representing possible histories of an action domain by answer sets, on efficient implementations of the answer set semantics and their use for generating plans, and on causal logic and its relation to planning algorithms. Recent progress in these areas may lead to the creation of planners which are based on the ideas of logic programming and combine the use of expressive action description languages with efficient computational procedures.

This book presents, within a conceptually unified theoretical framework, a body of methods that have been developed over the past fifteen years for building and simulating qualitative models of physical systems - bathtubs, tea kettles, automobiles, the physiology of the body, chemical processing plants, control systems, electrical systems - where knowledge of that system is incomplete. The primary tool for this work is the author's QSIM algorithm, which is discussed in detail. Qualitative models are better able than traditional models to express states of incomplete knowledge about continuous mechanisms. Qualitative simulation guarantees to find all possible behaviors consistent with the knowledge in the model. This expressive power and coverage is important in problem solving for diagnosis, design, monitoring, explanation, and other applications of artificial intelligence.

The original paper on Inverse Planning, a computational implementation of Theory of Mind. Humans are adept at inferring the mental states underlying other agents‚Äô actions, such as goals, beliefs, desires, emotions and other thoughts. This paper proposes a computational framework based on Bayesian inverse planning for modeling human action understanding. The framework represents an intuitive theory of intentional agents‚Äô behavior based on the principle of rationality: the expectation that agents will plan approximately rationally to achieve their goals, given their beliefs about the world. The mental states that caused an agent's behavior are inferred by inverting this model of rational planning using Bayesian inference, integrating the likelihood of the observed actions with the prior over mental states.

Experimental games model situations in which the future outcomes of individuals and groups depend on their own choices and on those of other (groups of) individuals. Games are a powerful tool to identify the neural and psychological mechanisms underlying interpersonal and group cooperation and coordination. This review article discusses recent developments in how experimental games are used and adapted, with an increased focus on repeated interactions, partner control through sanctioning, and partner (de)selection for future interactions.

Towards the goal of building machine-learning algorithms with human-like social intelligence, this paper develops a generative model of multiagent action understanding based on a novel representation for these latent relationships called Composable Team Hierarchies (CTH). This representation is grounded in the formalism of stochastic games and multi-agent reinforcement learning. This work uses CTH as a target for Bayesian inference yielding a new algorithm for understanding behavior in groups that can both infer hidden relationships as well as predict future actions for multiple agents interacting together.
