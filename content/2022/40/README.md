*   [DES is not a group](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/3-540-48071-4_36.pdf) - Old but gold mathematical proof that the set of DES permutations (encryption and decryption for each DES key) is not closed under functional composition. That means that multiple DES encryption is not equivalent to single DES encryption and means that the size of the subgroup generated by the set of DES permutations is greater than 10^2499, which is too large for potential attacks on DES, which would exploit a small subgroup.

### Specific topics / Cryptanalysis
