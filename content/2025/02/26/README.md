## [3. Awesome Agi Cocosci](/content/YuzheSHI/awesome-agi-cocosci/README.md)

### Domain Specific Language / DSL Program Synthesis

*   [Expert-level protocol translation for self-driving labs](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2024/hash/54dd9e0cff6d9214e20d97eb2a3bae49-Abstract-Conference.html) - ***NeurIPS'24***, 2024. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13997597682274906943)]. Recent development in Artificial Intelligence (AI) models has propelled their application in scientific discovery, but the validation and exploration of these discoveries require subsequent empirical experimentation. The concept of self-driving laboratories promises to automate and thus boost the experimental process following AI-driven discoveries. However, the transition of experimental protocols, originally crafted for human comprehension, into formats interpretable by machines presents significant challenges, which, within the context of specific expert domain, encompass the necessity for structured as opposed to natural language, the imperative for explicit rather than tacit knowledge, and the preservation of causality and consistency throughout protocol steps. Presently, the task of protocol translation predominantly requires the manual and labor-intensive involvement of domain experts and information technology specialists, rendering the process time-intensive. To address these issues, this work proposes a framework that automates the protocol translation process through a three-stage workflow, which incrementally constructs Protocol Dependence Graphs (PDGs) that approach structured on the syntax level, completed on the semantics level, and linked on the execution level. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations have demonstrated its performance at par with that of human experts, underscoring its potential to significantly expedite and democratize the process of scientific discovery by elevating the automation capabilities within self-driving laboratories.
