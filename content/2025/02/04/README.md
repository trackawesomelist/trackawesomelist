## [1. Awesome Agi Cocosci](/content/YuzheSHI/awesome-agi-cocosci/README.md)

### Science Logology / AI Assisted Research

*   [An augmented reality microscope with real-time artificial intelligence integration for cancer diagnosis](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-019-0539-7) - ***Nature Medicine***, 2019. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3280260879383275625)]. The microscopic assessment of tissue samples is instrumental for the diagnosis and staging of cancer, and thus guides therapy. However, these assessments demonstrate considerable variability and many regions of the world lack access to trained pathologists. Though artificial intelligence (AI) promises to improve the access and quality of healthcare, the costs of image digitization in pathology and difficulties in deploying AI solutions remain as barriers to real-world use. This work proposes a cost-effective solution: the augmented reality microscope (ARM). The ARM overlays AI-based information onto the current view of the sample in real time, enabling seamless integration of AI into routine workflows.
