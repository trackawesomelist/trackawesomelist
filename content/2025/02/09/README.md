### Bayesian Modeling / Generative Model

*   [Where do hypotheses come from?](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010028516302766) - ***Cognitive Psychology***, 2017. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17480320046655923235)]. \[[Preprint](https://gershmanlab.com/pubs/Dasgupta17.pdf)]. Why are human inferences sometimes remarkably close to the Bayesian ideal and other times systematically biased? In particular, why do humans make near-rational inferences in some natural domains where the candidate hypotheses are explicitly available, whereas tasks in similar domains requiring the self-generation of hypotheses produce systematic deviations from rational inference. This work proposes that these deviations arise from algorithmic processes approximating Bayes’ rule. Specifically in our account, hypotheses are generated stochastically from a sampling process, such that the sampled hypotheses form a Monte Carlo approximation of the posterior.
