### Bayesian Modeling / Nonparametric Model

*   [Nonparametric Bayesian Logic](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.5555/3020336.3020347) - ***UAI'05***, 2005. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=18267211625980322095)]. \[[Preprint](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~nando/papers/npblog.pdf)]. The Bayesian Logic (BLOG) language was recently developed for defining first-order probability models over worlds with unknown numbers of objects. It handles important problems in AI, including data association and population estimation. This paper extends BLOG by adopting generative processes over function spaces ‚Äî known as nonparametrics in the Bayesian literature. This work introduces syntax for reasoning about arbitrary collections of objects, and their properties, in an intuitive manner. By exploiting exchangeability, distributions over unknown objects and their attributes are cast as Dirichlet processes, which resolve difficulties in model selection and inference caused by varying numbers of objects.
