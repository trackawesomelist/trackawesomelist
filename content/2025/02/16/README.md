    *   "bridges the gap between Java and Common Lisp by incrementally translating Java bytecode into Lisp, which is then compiled into native machine code for execution. This unique approach allows Java classes to be seamlessly mapped to Common Lisp Object System (CLOS) classes, enabling effortless integration between Java and Common Lisp codebases."
