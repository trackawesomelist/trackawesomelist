### Bayesian Modeling / Generative Model

*   [Cooperative Training of Descriptor and Generator Networks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8519332) - ***IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence***, 2018. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=18202808849093155435)]. This paper studies the cooperative training of two generative models for image modeling and synthesis. Both models are parametrized by convolutional neural networks (ConvNets). The first model is a deep energy-based model, whose energy function is defined by a bottom-up ConvNet, which maps the observed image to the energy. We call it the descriptor network. The second model is a generator network, which is a non-linear version of factor analysis. It is defined by a top-down ConvNet, which maps the latent factors to the observed image. The maximum likelihood learning algorithms of both models involve MCMC sampling such as Langevin dynamics. This work observes that the two learning algorithms can be seamlessly interwoven into a cooperative learning algorithm that can train both models simultaneously. Specifically, within each iteration of the cooperative learning algorithm, the generator model generates initial synthesized examples to initialize a finite-step MCMC that samples and trains the energy-based descriptor model. After that, the generator model learns from how the MCMC changes its synthesized examples. That is, the descriptor model teaches the generator model by MCMC, so that the generator model accumulates the MCMC transitions and reproduces them by direct ancestral sampling.

### Science Logology / AI Assisted Research

*   [Virtual and augmented reality for biomedical applications](https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791\(21\)00197-X) - ***Cell Reports Medicine***, 2021. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14732259085495422063)]. 3D visualization technologies such as virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR) have gained popularity in the recent decade. Digital extended reality (XR) technologies have been adopted in various domains ranging from entertainment to education because of their accessibility and affordability. XR modalities create an immersive experience, enabling 3D visualization of the content without a conventional 2D display constraint. This paper provides a perspective on XR in current biomedical applications and demonstrate case studies using cell biology concepts, multiplexed proteomics images, surgical data for heart operations, and cardiac 3D models. Emerging challenges associated with XR technologies in the context of adverse health effects and a cost comparison of distinct platforms are discussed. The presented XR platforms will be useful for biomedical education, medical training, surgical guidance, and molecular data visualization to enhance trainees‚Äô and students‚Äô learning, medical operation accuracy, and the comprehensibility of complex biological systems.
*   [An augmented reality microscope with real-time artificial intelligence integration for cancer diagnosis](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-019-0539-7) - ***Nature Medicine***, 2019. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3280260879383275625)]. The microscopic assessment of tissue samples is instrumental for the diagnosis and staging of cancer, and thus guides therapy. However, these assessments demonstrate considerable variability and many regions of the world lack access to trained pathologists. Though artificial intelligence (AI) promises to improve the access and quality of healthcare, the costs of image digitization in pathology and difficulties in deploying AI solutions remain as barriers to real-world use. This work proposes a cost-effective solution: the augmented reality microscope (ARM). The ARM overlays AI-based information onto the current view of the sample in real time, enabling seamless integration of AI into routine workflows.
