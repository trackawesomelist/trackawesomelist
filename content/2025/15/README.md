### Abduction / Scientific Discovery

*   [Complexity Management in a Discovery Task](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/94n547fj) - ***CogSci'92***, 1992. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=18138712608977258974)]. Previous psychological research about scientific discovery has often focused on subjects' heuristics for discovering simple concepts with one relevant dimension or a few relevant dimensions with simple two-way interactions. This paper presents results from an experiment in which subjects had to discover a concept involving complex three-way interactions on a multi-valued output by running experiments in a computerized microworld. Twenty-two CMU undergraduates attempted the task, of which sixteen succeeded, in an average of 85 minutes. The analyses focus on three strategies used to regulate task complexity. First, subjects preferred depth-first to breadth-first search, with successful subjects regulating the number of features varied from experiment to experiment most effectively. Second, subjects systematically regulated the length of their experiments. Third, a new explicit search heuristic (Put Upon Stack Heuristic) used by successful subjects is described.

### Abduction / Rationalization

*   [Coalescing the Vapors of Human Experience into a Viable and Meaningful Comprehension](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/5f64z7d7) - ***CogSci'16***, 2016. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5460385008324352958)]. Models of concept learning and theory acquisition often invoke a stochastic search process, in which learners generate hypotheses through some structured random process and thenevaluate them on some data measuring their quality or value. To be successful within a reasonable time-frame, these models need ways of generating good candidate hypotheses evenbefore the data are considered. Schulz (2012a) has proposed that studying the origins of new ideas in more everyday contexts, such as how we think up new names for things, can provide insight into the cognitive processes that generate good hypotheses for learning. We propose a simple generative model for how people might draw on their experience to propose new names in everyday domains such as pub names or action movies, and show that it captures surprisingly well the names that people actually imagine. We discuss the role for an analogous hypothesis-generation mechanism in enabling and constraining causal theory learning.

### Abduction / Applications in AI

*   [Probabilistic Sufficient Explanations](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2021/0424.pdf) - ***IJCAI'21***, 2021. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1874102360688341104)]. Understanding the behavior of learned classifiers is an important task, and various black-box explanations, logical reasoning approaches, and model-specific methods have been proposed. This paper introduces probabilistic sufficient explanations, which formulate explaining an instance of classification as choosing the "simplest" subset of features such that only observing those features is "sufficient" to explain the classification. That is, sufficient to give us strong probabilistic guarantees that the model will behave similarly when all features are observed under the data distribution. In addition, the authors leverage tractable probabilistic reasoning tools such as probabilistic circuits and expected predictions to design a scalable algorithm for finding the desired explanations while keeping the guarantees intact. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in finding sufficient explanations, and showcase its advantages compared to Anchors and logical explanations.
