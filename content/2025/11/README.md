## [9. Awesome Agi Cocosci](/content/YuzheSHI/awesome-agi-cocosci/week/README.md)

### Concepts / Human Concept Representation

*   [Navigating cognition: Spatial codes for human thinking](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.aat6766) - ***Science***, 2018. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1407237757770081862)]. \[[Preprint](https://doellerlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Bellmund_et_al_2018_Science_Navigating-cognition.pdf)]. The hippocampal formation has long been suggested to underlie both memory formation and spatial navigation. This work discusses how neural mechanisms identified in spatial navigation research operate across information domains to support a wide spectrum of cognitive functions. In the proposed framework, place and grid cell population codes provide a representational format to map variable dimensions of cognitive spaces. This highly dynamic mapping system enables rapid reorganization of codes through remapping between orthogonal representations across behavioral contexts, yielding a multitude of stable cognitive spaces at different resolutions and hierarchical levels. Action sequences result in trajectories through cognitive space, which can be simulated via sequential coding in the hippocampus. In this way, the spatial representational format of the hippocampal formation has the capacity to support flexible cognition and behavior.
*   [Structuring Knowledge with Cognitive Maps and Cognitive Graphs](https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613\(20\)30250-3) - ***Trends in Cognitive Sciences***, 2021. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7196012353183004425)]. \[[Preprint](https://www.sas.upenn.edu/psych/epsteinlab/pdfs/Peer%20Brunec%20Newcombe%20Epstein%20TiCS%202020%20Cog%20maps%20and%20cog%20graphs.pdf)]. Humans and animals use mental representations of the spatial structure of the world to navigate. The classical view is that these representations take the form of Euclidean cognitive maps, but alternative theories suggest that they are cognitive graphs consisting of locations connected by paths. The authors review evidence suggesting that both map-like and graph-like representations exist in the mind/brain that rely on partially overlapping neural systems. Maps and graphs can operate simultaneously or separately, and they may be applied to both spatial and nonspatial knowledge. By providing structural frameworks for complex information, cognitive maps and cognitive graphs may provide fundamental organizing schemata that allow us to navigate in physical, social, and conceptual spaces.
