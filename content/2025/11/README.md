### Concepts / Human Concept Representation

*   [Navigating cognition: Spatial codes for human thinking](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.aat6766) - ***Science***, 2018. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1407237757770081862)]. \[[Preprint](https://doellerlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Bellmund_et_al_2018_Science_Navigating-cognition.pdf)]. The hippocampal formation has long been suggested to underlie both memory formation and spatial navigation. This work discusses how neural mechanisms identified in spatial navigation research operate across information domains to support a wide spectrum of cognitive functions. In the proposed framework, place and grid cell population codes provide a representational format to map variable dimensions of cognitive spaces. This highly dynamic mapping system enables rapid reorganization of codes through remapping between orthogonal representations across behavioral contexts, yielding a multitude of stable cognitive spaces at different resolutions and hierarchical levels. Action sequences result in trajectories through cognitive space, which can be simulated via sequential coding in the hippocampus. In this way, the spatial representational format of the hippocampal formation has the capacity to support flexible cognition and behavior.
*   [Structuring Knowledge with Cognitive Maps and Cognitive Graphs](https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613\(20\)30250-3) - ***Trends in Cognitive Sciences***, 2021. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7196012353183004425)]. \[[Preprint](https://www.sas.upenn.edu/psych/epsteinlab/pdfs/Peer%20Brunec%20Newcombe%20Epstein%20TiCS%202020%20Cog%20maps%20and%20cog%20graphs.pdf)]. Humans and animals use mental representations of the spatial structure of the world to navigate. The classical view is that these representations take the form of Euclidean cognitive maps, but alternative theories suggest that they are cognitive graphs consisting of locations connected by paths. The authors review evidence suggesting that both map-like and graph-like representations exist in the mind/brain that rely on partially overlapping neural systems. Maps and graphs can operate simultaneously or separately, and they may be applied to both spatial and nonspatial knowledge. By providing structural frameworks for complex information, cognitive maps and cognitive graphs may provide fundamental organizing schemata that allow us to navigate in physical, social, and conceptual spaces.
*   [Natural speech reveals the semantic maps that tile human cerebral cortex](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature17637) - ***Nature***, 2016. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14997953800741854188)]. \[[Preprint](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/cbs/rclcn/images/cdl_articles/H/Huth_et_al._2016.pdf)]. \[[Code & Tutorial (‚≠ê32)](https://github.com/HuthLab/speechmodeltutorial)]. The meaning of language is represented in regions of the cerebral cortex collectively known as the ‚Äòsemantic system‚Äô. However, little of the semantic system has been mapped comprehensively, and the semantic selectivity of most regions is unknown. This work systematically maps semantic selectivity across the cortex using voxel-wise modelling of functional MRI (fMRI) data collected while subjects listened to hours of narrative stories. This work shows that the semantic system is organized into intricate patterns that seem to be consistent across individuals. The authors then use a novel generative model to create a detailed semantic atlas. The results suggest that most areas within the semantic system represent information about specific semantic domains, or groups of related concepts, and the atlas shows which domains are represented in each area. This study demonstrates that data-driven methods---commonplace in studies of human neuroanatomy and functional connectivity---provide a powerful and efficient means for mapping functional representations in the brain.
*   [Idiosyncratic Tower of Babel: Individual differences in word-meaning representation increase as word abstractness increases](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09567976211003877) - ***Psychological Science***, 2021. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=18214600097352809308)]. \[[All Versions](http://bilab.bnu.edu.cn/paper/2021/Wang_2021_Psychology%20Science.pdf)]. Humans primarily rely on language to communicate, on the basis of a shared understanding of the basic building blocks of communication: words. Do we mean the same things when we use the same words? Although cognitive neural research on semantics has revealed the common principles of word-meaning representation, the factors underlying the potential individual variations in word meanings are unknown. This work empirically characterized the intersubject consistency of 90 words across 20 adult subjects (10 female) using both behavioral measures (rating-based semantic-relationship patterns) and neuroimaging measures (word-evoked brain activity patterns). Across both the behavioral and neuroimaging experiments, this work showed that the magnitude of individual disagreements on word meanings could be modeled on the basis of how much language or sensory experience is associated with a word and that this variation increases with word abstractness. Uncovering the cognitive and neural origins of word-meaning disagreements across individuals has implications for potential mechanisms to modulate such disagreements.
