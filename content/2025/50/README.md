### Domain Specific Language / Declarative DSL Applications

*   [Penrose: from mathematical notation to beautiful diagrams](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3386569.3392375) - ***ACM Transactions on Graphics***, 2020. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7935816003253127595)]. This work introduces a system called Penrose for creating mathematical diagrams. Its basic functionality is to translate abstract statements written in familiar math-like notation into one or more possible visual representations. Rather than rely on a fixed library of visualization tools, the visual representation is user-defined in a constraint-based specification language; diagrams are then generated automatically via constrained numerical optimization. The system is user-extensible to many domains of mathematics, and is fast enough for iterative design exploration. In contrast to tools that specify diagrams via direct manipulation or low-level graphics programming, Penrose enables rapid creation and exploration of diagrams that faithfully preserve the underlying mathematical meaning. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the system by showing how it can be used to illustrate a diverse set of concepts from mathematics and computer graphics.

### System 1 & System 2 / Neural-Symbolic AI

*   [How large language models need symbolism](https://academic.oup.com/nsr/article/12/10/nwaf339/8237444) - ***National Science Review***, 2025. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9866048591424428891)]. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs), have achieved remarkable success. This progress stems from ‘scaling laws’---performance improves with greater computation, data and model size. However, this paradigm has a crucial vulnerability: scaling laws are effective only when data are abundant. A foundational process for this is the human ability of ‘quotienting’: creating a compact symbolic space from a vast problem space, in a process akin to forming a mathematical quotient space via equivalence classes. The new strategy uses symbols as vessels for compressed human wisdom, creating maps that guide the powerful statistical intuition of LLMs, which is especially critical for tackling complex problems where usable data are, by nature, sparse. The next frontier for AI will not be conquered by scaling alone. The art of symbolization itself—the crafting of powerful abstractions—is therefore the central task ahead. If scaling laws have given models their powerful intuition, it is the art of the symbol that will provide the compass for genuine discovery.
