### Domain Specific Language / Declarative DSL Applications

*   [Penrose: from mathematical notation to beautiful diagrams](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3386569.3392375) - ***ACM Transactions on Graphics***, 2020. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7935816003253127595)]. This work introduces a system called Penrose for creating mathematical diagrams. Its basic functionality is to translate abstract statements written in familiar math-like notation into one or more possible visual representations. Rather than rely on a fixed library of visualization tools, the visual representation is user-defined in a constraint-based specification language; diagrams are then generated automatically via constrained numerical optimization. The system is user-extensible to many domains of mathematics, and is fast enough for iterative design exploration. In contrast to tools that specify diagrams via direct manipulation or low-level graphics programming, Penrose enables rapid creation and exploration of diagrams that faithfully preserve the underlying mathematical meaning. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the system by showing how it can be used to illustrate a diverse set of concepts from mathematics and computer graphics.
*   [LegalLanguage: A Domain-Specific Language for Legal Contexts](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-37933-9_3) - ***EEWC'19***, 2019. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12637991160754186719)]. Nowadays legal ontologies have been used in the legal domain, however, being poorly explored in legislative and production processes. This paper analyses the adoption of legal ontologies as a tool to support these processes, in particular, related to activities span from the submission of bills and their subsequent authoring and ratification. This paper introduces the state of the art of legal (or normative) ontologies; and also discusses some application examples. The analysis of this state of the art allows us to identify some problems, namely regarding the activities involving the authoring and validation of laws that tend to be very human-intensive and error-prone. As a consequence of this analysis, the authors introduce the LegalLanguage, a language particularly suitable for the authoring and specification of law(s) in a more rigorous and systematic way, that would allow to keep track different types of intra and inter-laws relationships (e.g., structural, order or temporal relationships between articles or even between laws).

### System 1 & System 2 / Neural-Symbolic AI

*   [How large language models need symbolism](https://academic.oup.com/nsr/article/12/10/nwaf339/8237444) - ***National Science Review***, 2025. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9866048591424428891)]. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs), have achieved remarkable success. This progress stems from ‘scaling laws’---performance improves with greater computation, data and model size. However, this paradigm has a crucial vulnerability: scaling laws are effective only when data are abundant. A foundational process for this is the human ability of ‘quotienting’: creating a compact symbolic space from a vast problem space, in a process akin to forming a mathematical quotient space via equivalence classes. The new strategy uses symbols as vessels for compressed human wisdom, creating maps that guide the powerful statistical intuition of LLMs, which is especially critical for tackling complex problems where usable data are, by nature, sparse. The next frontier for AI will not be conquered by scaling alone. The art of symbolization itself—the crafting of powerful abstractions—is therefore the central task ahead. If scaling laws have given models their powerful intuition, it is the art of the symbol that will provide the compass for genuine discovery.
