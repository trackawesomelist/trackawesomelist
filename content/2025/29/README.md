## [11. Awesome Agi Cocosci](/content/YuzheSHI/awesome-agi-cocosci/week/README.md)

### Domain Specific Language / Design Practises

*   [A Taxonomy of Domain-Specific Aspect Languages](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2685028) - ***ACM Computing Surveys***, 2015. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17254174131160041640)]. Domain-Specific Aspect Languages (DSALs) are Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) designed to express crosscutting concerns. Compared to DSLs, their aspectual nature greatly amplifies the language design space. This survey structures this space in order to shed light on and compare the different domain-specific approaches to deal with crosscutting concerns. This survey reports on a corpus of 36 DSALs covering the space, discuss a set of design considerations, and provide a taxonomy of DSAL implementation approaches. This work serves as a frame of reference to DSAL and DSL researchers, enabling further advances in the field, and to developers as a guide for DSAL implementations.

### Domain Specific Language / Imperative DSL Applications

*   [Infinigen Indoors: Photorealistic Indoor Scenes using Procedural Generation](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/html/Raistrick_Infinigen_Indoors_Photorealistic_Indoor_Scenes_using_Procedural_Generation_CVPR_2024_paper.html) - ***CVPR'24***, 2024. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14526967027465419958)]. This work introduces Infinigen Indoors, a Blender-based procedural generator of photorealistic indoor scenes. It builds upon the existing Infinigen system, which focuses on natural scenes, but expands its coverage to indoor scenes by introducing a diverse library of procedural indoor assets, including furniture, architecture elements, appliances, and other day-to-day objects. It also introduces a constraint-based arrangement system, which consists of a domain-specific language for expressing diverse constraints on scene composition, and a solver that generates scene compositions that maximally satisfy the constraints. The authors provide an export tool that allows the generated 3D objects and scenes to be directly used for training embodied agents in real-time simulators such as Omniverse and Unreal. Infinigen Indoors is open-sourced under the BSD license.
*   ["We Need Structured Output": Towards User-centered Constraints on Large Language Model Output](https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3613905.3650756) - ***CHI EA'24***, 2024. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12105435542197416648)]. \[[Preprint](https://research.google/pubs/we-need-structured-output-towards-user-centered-constraints-on-large-language-model-output/)]. Large language models can produce creative and diverse responses. However, to integrate them into current developer workflows, it is essential to constrain their outputs to follow specific formats or standards. This work surveyed 51 experienced industry professionals to understand the range of scenarios and motivations driving the need for output constraints from a user-centered perspective. The authors identified 134 concrete use cases for constraints at two levels: low-level, which ensures the output adhere to a structured format and an appropriate length, and high-level, which requires the output to follow semantic and stylistic guidelines without hallucination. Critically, applying output constraints could not only streamline the currently repetitive process of developing, testing, and integrating LLM prompts for developers, but also enhance the user experience of LLM-powered features and applications. The authors conclude with a discussion on user preferences and needs towards articulating intended constraints for LLMs, alongside an initial design for a constraint prototyping tool.

### Domain Specific Language / Declarative DSL Applications

*   [Artificial intelligence driven design of catalysts and materials for ring opening polymerization using a domain-specific language](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39396-3) - ***Nature Communications***, 2023. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=6595955912508683146)]. \[[Project (‚≠ê14)](https://github.com/IBM/ibm-materials-notebook)]. Advances in machine learning (ML) and automated experimentation are poised to vastly accelerate research in polymer science. Data representation is a critical aspect for enabling ML integration in research workflows, yet many data models impose significant rigidity making it difficult to accommodate a broad array of experiment and data types found in polymer science. This inflexibility presents a significant barrier for researchers to leverage their historical data in ML development. This work shows that a domain specific language, termed Chemical Markdown Language (CMDL), provides flexible, extensible, and consistent representation of disparate experiment types and polymer structures. CMDL enables seamless use of historical experimental data to fine-tune regression transformer (RT) models for generative molecular design tasks. The authors demonstrate the utility of this approach through the generation and the experimental validation of catalysts and polymers in the context of ring-opening polymerization---although the authors provide examples of how CMDL can be more broadly applied to other polymer classes. Critically, this work shows how the CMDL tuned model preserves key functional groups within the polymer structure, allowing for experimental validation. These results reveal the versatility of CMDL and how it facilitates translation of historical data into meaningful predictive and generative models to produce experimentally actionable output.
*   [Configurable 3D Scene Synthesis and 2D Image Rendering with Per-pixel Ground Truth Using Stochastic Grammars](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11263-018-1103-5) - ***International Journal of Computer Vision***, 2018. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=8301697457354598778)]. \[[Preprint](https://yzhu.io/publication/scenesynthesis2018ijcv/paper.pdf)]. This work proposes a systematic learning-based approach to the generation of massive quantities of synthetic 3D scenes and arbitrary numbers of photorealistic 2D images thereof, with associated ground truth information, for the purposes of training, benchmarking, and diagnosing learning-based computer vision and robotics algorithms. In particular, the authors devise a learning-based pipeline of algorithms capable of automatically generating and rendering a potentially infinite variety of indoor scenes by using a stochastic grammar, represented as an attributed Spatial And-Or Graph, in conjunction with state-of-the-art physics-based rendering. The pipeline is capable of synthesizing scene layouts with high diversity, and it is configurable inasmuch as it enables the precise customization and control of important attributes of the generated scenes. It renders photorealistic RGB images of the generated scenes while automatically synthesizing detailed, per-pixel ground truth data, including visible surface depth and normal, object identity, and material information (detailed to object parts), as well as environments (e.g., illuminations and camera viewpoints). The authors demonstrate the value of the synthesized dataset, by improving performance in certain machine-learning-based scene understanding tasks‚Äîdepth and surface normal prediction, semantic segmentation, reconstruction, etc.---and by providing benchmarks for and diagnostics of trained models by modifying object attributes and scene properties in a controllable manner.

### Domain Specific Language / Logic DSL Applications

*   [Genetic circuit design automation with Cello 2.0](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-021-00675-2) - ***Nature Protocol***, 2022. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7418307542591684967)]. \[[Preprint](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Samuel-Oliveira-38/publication/358801979_Genetic_circuit_design_automation_with_Cello_20/links/635debf412cbac6a3e0b19e4/Genetic-circuit-design-automation-with-Cello-20.pdf)]. Cells interact with their environment, communicate among themselves, track time and make decisions through functions controlled by natural regulatory genetic circuits consisting of interacting biological components. Synthetic programmable circuits used in therapeutics and other applications can be automatically designed by computer-aided tools. The Cello software designs the DNA sequences for programmable circuits based on a high-level software description and a library of characterized DNA parts representing Boolean logic gates. This process allows for design specification reuse, modular DNA part library curation and formalized circuit transformations based on experimental data. This protocol describes Cello 2.0, a freely available cross-platform software written in Java. Cello 2.0 enables flexible descriptions of the logic gates‚Äô structure and their mathematical models representing dynamic behavior, new formal rules for describing the placement of gates in a genome, a new graphical user interface, support for Verilog 2005 syntax and a connection to the SynBioHub parts repository software environment. Collectively, these features expand Cello‚Äôs capabilities beyond Escherichia coli plasmids to new organisms and broader genetic contexts, including the genome. Designing circuits with Cello 2.0 produces an abstract Boolean network from a Verilog file, assigns biological parts to each node in the Boolean network, constructs a DNA sequence and generates highly structured and annotated sequence representations suitable for downstream processing and fabrication, respectively. The result is a sequence implementing the specified Boolean function in the organism and predictions of circuit performance. Depending on the size of the design space and users‚Äô expertise, jobs may take minutes or hours to complete.
*   [The KoLMogorov Test: Compression by Code Generation](https://openreview.net/forum?id=C45YqeBDUM) - ***ICLR'25***, 2025. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=16809888292456252135)]. Compression is at the heart of intelligence. A theoretically optimal way to compress any sequence of data is to find the shortest program that outputs that sequence and then halts. However, such Kolmogorov compression is uncomputable, and code generating LLMs struggle to approximate this theoretical ideal, as it requires reasoning, planning and search capabilities beyond those of current models. This work introduces the KoLMogorov-Test (KT), a compression-as-intelligence intelligence test for code generation LLMs. In KT a model is presented with a sequence of data at inference time, and asked to generate the shortest DSL (designed specifically for the task) program that produces the sequence. The authors identify several benefits of KT for both evaluation and training: an essentially infinite number of problem instances of varying difficulty is readily available, strong baselines already exist, the evaluation metric (compression) cannot be gamed, and pretraining data contamination is highly unlikely. To evaluate current models, the authors use audio, text, and DNA data, as well as sequences produced by random synthetic DSL programs.
*   [Meta-analysis of the functional neuroimaging literature with probabilistic logic programming](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-21801-4) - ***Scientific Reports***, 2022. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5952076495542489316)]. Inferring reliable brain-behavior associations requires synthesizing evidence from thousands of functional neuroimaging studies through meta-analysis. However, existing meta-analysis tools are limited to investigating simple neuroscience concepts and expressing a restricted range of questions. This work expands the scope of neuroimaging meta-analysis by designing NeuroLang: a domain-specific language to express and test hypotheses using probabilistic first-order logic programming. By leveraging formalisms found at the crossroads of artificial intelligence and knowledge representation, NeuroLang provides the expressivity to address a larger repertoire of hypotheses in a meta-analysis, while seamlessly modeling the uncertainty inherent to neuroimaging data. The authors demonstrate the language‚Äôs capabilities in conducting comprehensive neuroimaging meta-analysis through use-case examples that address questions of structure-function associations. Specifically, the authors infer the specific functional roles of three canonical brain networks, support the role of the visual word-form area in visuospatial attention, and investigate the heterogeneous organization of the frontoparietal control network.

### Domain Specific Language / DSL Program Synthesis

*   [Synthesizing theories of human language with Bayesian program induction](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-32012-w) - ***Nature Communications***, 2022. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=8603772394100237159)]. Automated, data-driven construction and evaluation of scientific models and theories is a long-standing challenge in artificial intelligence. This work presents a framework for algorithmically synthesizing models of a basic part of human language: morpho-phonology, the system that builds word forms from sounds. The authors integrate Bayesian inference with program synthesis and representations inspired by linguistic theory and cognitive models of learning and discovery. Across 70 datasets from 58 diverse languages, the system synthesizes human-interpretable models for core aspects of each language‚Äôs morpho-phonology, sometimes approaching models posited by human linguists. Joint inference across all 70 data sets automatically synthesizes a meta-model encoding interpretable cross-language typological tendencies. Finally, the same algorithm captures few-shot learning dynamics, acquiring new morphophonological rules from just one or a few examples. These results suggest routes to more powerful machine-enabled discovery of interpretable models in linguistics and other scientific domains.
*   [Mathematical discoveries from program search with large language models](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06924-6) - ***Nature***, 2024. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5653439474813913484)]. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated tremendous capabilities in solving complex tasks, from quantitative reasoning to understanding natural language. However, LLMs sometimes suffer from confabulations (or hallucinations), which can result in them making plausible but incorrect statements1,2. This hinders the use of current large models in scientific discovery. This work introduces FunSearch (short for searching in the function space), an evolutionary procedure based on pairing a pretrained LLM with a systematic evaluator. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach to surpass the best-known results in important problems, pushing the boundary of existing LLM-based approaches3. Applying FunSearch to a central problem in extremal combinatorics‚Äîthe cap set problem‚Äîwe discover new constructions of large cap sets going beyond the best-known ones, both in finite dimensional and asymptotic cases. This shows that it is possible to make discoveries for established open problems using LLMs. The authors showcase the generality of FunSearch by applying it to an algorithmic problem, online bin packing, finding new heuristics that improve on widely used baselines. In contrast to most computer search approaches, FunSearch searches for programs that describe how to solve a problem, rather than what the solution is. Beyond being an effective and scalable strategy, discovered programs tend to be more interpretable than raw solutions, enabling feedback loops between domain experts and FunSearch, and the deployment of such programs in real-world applications.

### Domain Specific Language / Cognitive Foundations

*   [How laypeople evaluate scientific explanations containing jargon](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-025-02227-0) - ***Nature Human Behavior***, 2025. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=6467855047925175367)]. Individuals rely on others‚Äô expertise to achieve a basic understanding of the world. But how can non-experts achieve understanding from explanations that, by definition, they are ill-equipped to assess? Across 9 experiments with 6,698 participants (Study 1A‚Äâ=‚Äâ737; 1B‚Äâ=‚Äâ734; 1C‚Äâ=‚Äâ733; 2A‚Äâ=‚Äâ1,014; 2B‚Äâ=‚Äâ509; 2C‚Äâ=‚Äâ1,012; 3A‚Äâ=‚Äâ1,026; 3B‚Äâ=‚Äâ512; 4‚Äâ=‚Äâ421), this work addresses this puzzle by focusing on scientific explanations with jargon. The authors identify ‚Äòwhen‚Äô and ‚Äòwhy‚Äô the inclusion of jargon makes explanations more satisfying, despite decreasing their comprehensibility. The authors find that jargon increases satisfaction because laypeople assume the jargon fills gaps in explanations that are otherwise incomplete. The authors also identify strategies for debiasing these judgements: when people attempt to generate their own explanations, inflated judgements of poor explanations with jargon are reduced, and people become better calibrated in their assessments of their own ability to explain.

### Problem Solving / Human-Level Problem Solving

*   [Beyond imitation: Zero-shot task transfer on robots by learning concepts as cognitive programs](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/scirobotics.aav3150) - ***Science Robotics***, 2019. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7451223471302689228)]. Humans can infer concepts from image pairs and apply those in the physical world in a completely different setting, enabling tasks like IKEA assembly from diagrams. If robots could represent and infer high-level concepts, then it would notably improve their ability to understand our intent and to transfer tasks between different environments. To that end, the authors introduce a computational framework that replicates aspects of human concept learning. Concepts are represented as programs on a computer architecture consisting of a visual perception system, working memory, and action controller. The instruction set of this cognitive computer has commands for parsing a visual scene, directing gaze and attention, imagining new objects, manipulating the contents of a visual working memory, and controlling arm movement. Inferring a concept corresponds to inducing a program that can transform the input to the output. Some concepts require the use of imagination and recursion. Previously learned concepts simplify the learning of subsequent, more elaborate concepts and create a hierarchy of abstractions. The authors demonstrate how a robot can use these abstractions to interpret novel concepts presented to it as schematic images and then apply those concepts in very different situations. By bringing cognitive science ideas on mental imagery, perceptual symbols, embodied cognition, and deictic mechanisms into the realm of machine learning, this work brings researchers closer to the goal of building robots that have interpretable representations and common sense.

### System 1 & System 2 / Neural-Symbolic AI

*   [AI Feynman: A physics-inspired method for symbolic regression](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/sciadv.aay2631) - ***Science Advances***, 2019. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3655502646441210453)]. A core challenge for both physics and artificial intelligence (AI) is symbolic regression: finding a symbolic expression that matches data from an unknown function. Although this problem is likely to be NP-hard in principle, functions of practical interest often exhibit symmetries, separability, compositionality, and other simplifying properties. In this spirit, the authors develop a recursive multidimensional symbolic regression algorithm that combines neural network fitting with a suite of physics-inspired techniques. The authors apply it to 100 equations from the Feynman Lectures on Physics, and it discovers all of them, while previous publicly available software cracks only 71; for a more difficult physics-based test set, this work improves the state-of-the-art success rate from 15 to 90%.
*   [Semi-Supervised Abductive Learning and Its Application to Theft Judicial Sentencing](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9338352) - ***ICDM'20***, 2020. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=16646246740380524224)]. \[[Preprint](https://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn/huangyx/src/ICDM20-SSABL.pdf)]. In many practical tasks, there are usually two kinds of common information: cheap unlabeled data and domain knowledge in the form of symbols. There are some attempts using one single information source, such as semi-supervised learning and abductive learning. However, there is little work to use these two kinds of information sources at the same time, because it is very difficult to combine symbolic logical representation and numerical model optimization effectively. The learning becomes even more challenging when the domain knowledge is insufficient. This paper presents an attempt-Semi-Supervised ABductive Learning (SS-ABL) framework. In this framework, semi-supervised learning is trained via pseudo labels of unlabeled data generated by abductive learning, and the background knowledge is refined via the label distribution predicted by semi-supervised learning. The above framework can be optimized iteratively and can be naturally interpretable. The effectiveness of the framework has been fully verified in the theft judicial sentencing of real legal documents. In the case of missing sentencing elements and mixed legal rules, the framework is apparently superior to many existing baseline practices, and provides explanatory assistance to judicial sentencing.

### Explainability / Trustworthy AI

*   [A tale of two explanations: Enhancing human trust by explaining robot behavior](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scirobotics.aay4663) - ***Science Robotics***, 2019. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3985046411399524590)]. \[[Preprint](https://yzhu.io/publication/openbottle2019scirob/paper.pdf)]. The ability to provide comprehensive explanations of chosen actions is a hallmark of intelligence. Lack of this ability impedes the general acceptance of AI and robot systems in critical tasks. This paper examines what forms of explanations best foster human trust in machines and proposes a framework in which explanations are generated from both functional and mechanistic perspectives. The robot system learns from human demonstrations to open medicine bottles using (i) an embodied haptic prediction model to extract knowledge from sensory feedback, (ii) a stochastic grammar model induced to capture the compositional structure of a multistep task, and (iii) an improved Earley parsing algorithm to jointly leverage both the haptic and grammar models. The robot system not only shows the ability to learn from human demonstrators but also succeeds in opening new, unseen bottles. Using different forms of explanations generated by the robot system, we conducted a psychological experiment to examine what forms of explanations best foster human trust in the robot. The authors found that comprehensive and real-time visualizations of the robot‚Äôs internal decisions were more effective in promoting human trust than explanations based on summary text descriptions. In addition, forms of explanation that are best suited to foster trust do not necessarily correspond to the model components contributing to the best task performance. This divergence shows a need for the robotics community to integrate model components to enhance both task execution and human trust in machines.
*   [X-ToM: Explaining with Theory-of-Mind for Gaining Justified Human Trust](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.06907) - ***CVPR XAI Workshop'19***, 2019. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7751326666821697923)]. This work presents a new explainable AI (XAI) framework aimed at increasing justified human trust and reliance in the AI machine through explanations. The authors pose explanation as an iterative communication process, i.e. dialog, between the machine and human user. More concretely, the machine generates sequence of explanations in a dialog which takes into account three important aspects at each dialog turn: (a) human's intention (or curiosity); (b) human's understanding of the machine; and (c) machine's understanding of the human user. To do this, the authors use Theory of Mind (ToM) which helps us in explicitly modeling human's intention, machine's mind as inferred by the human as well as human's mind as inferred by the machine. In other words, these explicit mental representations in ToM are incorporated to learn an optimal explanation policy that takes into account human's perception and beliefs. Furthermore, the authors also show that ToM facilitates in quantitatively measuring justified human trust in the machine by comparing all the three mental representations.
    We applied our framework to three visual recognition tasks, namely, image classification, action recognition, and human body pose estimation. The authors argue that our ToM based explanations are practical and more natural for both expert and non-expert users to understand the internal workings of complex machine learning models. This is the first work to derive explanations using ToM. Extensive human study experiments verify our hypotheses, showing that the proposed explanations significantly outperform the state-of-the-art XAI methods in terms of all the standard quantitative and qualitative XAI evaluation metrics including human trust, reliance, and explanation satisfaction.
*   [Explaining machine learning models with interactive natural language conversations using TalkToModel](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-023-00692-8) - ***Nature Machine Intelligence***, 2023. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7044008493489695982)]. Practitioners increasingly use machine learning (ML) models, yet models have become more complex and harder to understand. To understand complex models, researchers have proposed techniques to explain model predictions. However, practitioners struggle to use explainability methods because they do not know which explanation to choose and how to interpret the explanation. This work addresses the challenge of using explainability methods by proposing TalkToModel: an interactive dialogue system that explains ML models through natural language conversations. TalkToModel consists of three components: an adaptive dialogue engine that interprets natural language and generates meaningful responses; an execution component that constructs the explanations used in the conversation; and a conversational interface. In real-world evaluations, 73% of healthcare workers agreed they would use TalkToModel over existing systems for understanding a disease prediction model, and 85% of ML professionals agreed TalkToModel was easier to use, demonstrating that TalkToModel is highly effective for model explainability.

### Science Logology / AI Assisted Research

*   [Machine learning-assisted molecular design and efficiency prediction for high-performance organic photovoltaic materials](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/sciadv.aay4275) - ***Science Advances***, 2019. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12392230644945701722)]. In the process of finding high-performance materials for organic photovoltaics (OPVs), it is meaningful if one can establish the relationship between chemical structures and photovoltaic properties even before synthesizing them. This work first establishes a database containing over 1700 donor materials reported in the literature. Through supervised learning, our machine learning (ML) models can build up the structure-property relationship and, thus, implement fast screening of OPV materials. The authors explore several expressions for molecule structures, i.e., images, ASCII strings, descriptors, and fingerprints, as inputs for various ML algorithms. It is found that fingerprints with length over 1000 bits can obtain high prediction accuracy. The reliability of the approach is further verified by screening 10 newly designed donor materials. Good consistency between model predictions and experimental outcomes is obtained. The result indicates that ML is a powerful tool to prescreen new OPV materials, thus accelerating the development of the OPV field.
*   [Design of metalloproteins and novel protein folds using variational autoencoders](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-34533-1) - ***Scientific Reports***, 2018. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=18126187509308242959)]. The design of novel proteins has many applications but remains an attritional process with success in isolated cases. Meanwhile, deep learning technologies have exploded in popularity in recent years and are increasingly applicable to biology due to the rise in available data. This work attempts to link protein design and deep learning by using variational autoencoders to generate protein sequences conditioned on desired properties. Potential copper and calcium binding sites are added to non-metal binding proteins without human intervention and compared to a hidden Markov model. In another use case, a grammar of protein structures is developed and used to produce sequences for a novel protein topology. One candidate structure is found to be stable by molecular dynamics simulation. The ability of the model to confine the vast search space of protein sequences and to scale easily has the potential to assist in a variety of protein design tasks.

> Takenoko: A long time ago at the Japanese Imperial court, the Chinese Emperor offered a giant panda bear as a symbol of peace to the Japanese Emperor. Since then, the Japanese Emperor has entrusted his court members (the players) with the difficult task of caring for the animal by tending to his bamboo garden.
>
> In Takenoko, the players will cultivate land plots, irrigate them, and grow one of the three species of bamboo (Green, Yellow, and Pink) with the help of the Imperial gardener to maintain this bamboo garden. They will have to bear with the immoderate hunger of this sacred animal for the juicy and tender bamboo. The player who manages his land plots best, growing the most bamboo while feeding the delicate appetite of the panda, will win the game.
