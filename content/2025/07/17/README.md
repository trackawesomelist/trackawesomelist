## [1. Awesome Agi Cocosci](/content/YuzheSHI/awesome-agi-cocosci/README.md)

### Science Logology / Literature Mining

*   [An intelligent guided troubleshooting method for aircraft based on HybirdRAG](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-02643-2) - ***Scientific Reports***, 2025. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4924119792997395046)]. To enhance aircraft fault diagnosis efficiency, this paper proposes HybridRAG, an intelligent-guided troubleshooting framework that integrates knowledge graphs and large language models (LLMs). Unlike conventional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods that rely on single-modal retrieval, HybridRAG adopts a multi-dimensional retrieval strategy, combining graph-based reasoning with both vector-based and BM25-based text retrieval techniques. This hybrid approach ensures comprehensive extraction of relevant information from both unstructured text and structured fault graphs, enhancing diagnostic precision, relevance, and robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that HybridRAG achieves an F1 score improvement of at least 4% and reduces hallucination rates by over 7% compared to mainstream RAG baselines. These advancements, combined with its unique integration of multi-modal retrieval, position HybridRAG as a novel framework for addressing complex aircraft maintenance challenges. Additionally, the paper presents an agent-based intelligent troubleshooting assistant that supports more interactive, adaptive, and flexible diagnostic Q\&A, providing maintenance personnel with a significant advanced intelligent, context-aware diagnostic tool.
