## [1. Awesome Agi Cocosci](/content/YuzheSHI/awesome-agi-cocosci/README.md)

### Domain Specific Language / Logic DSL Applications

*   [MoVer: Motion Verification for Motion Graphics Animations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13372) - 2025. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=527747131334466686)]. While large vision-language models can generate motion graphics animations from text prompts, they regularly fail to include all of spatio-temporal properties described in the prompt. This work introduces MoVer, a motion verification DSL based on first-order logic that can check spatio-temporal properties of a motion graphics animation. The authors identify a general set of such properties that people commonly use to describe animations (e.g., the direction and timing of motions, the relative positioning of objects, etc.). The authors implement these properties as predicates in MoVer and provide an execution engine that can apply a MoVer program to any input SVG-based motion graphics animation. The authors then demonstrate how MoVer can be used in an LLM-based synthesis and verification pipeline for iteratively refining motion graphics animations. Given a text prompt, the pipeline synthesizes a motion graphics animation and a corresponding MoVer program. Executing the verification program on the animation yields a report of the predicates that failed and the report can be automatically fed back to LLM to iteratively correct the animation.
