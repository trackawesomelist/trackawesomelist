## [26. Awesome Agi Cocosci](/content/YuzheSHI/awesome-agi-cocosci/week/README.md)

### Bayesian Modeling / Nonparametric Model

*   [Nonparametric Bayesian Logic](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.5555/3020336.3020347) - ***UAI'05***, 2005. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=18267211625980322095)]. \[[Preprint](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~nando/papers/npblog.pdf)]. The Bayesian Logic (BLOG) language was recently developed for defining first-order probability models over worlds with unknown numbers of objects. It handles important problems in AI, including data association and population estimation. This paper extends BLOG by adopting generative processes over function spaces ‚Äî known as nonparametrics in the Bayesian literature. This work introduces syntax for reasoning about arbitrary collections of objects, and their properties, in an intuitive manner. By exploiting exchangeability, distributions over unknown objects and their attributes are cast as Dirichlet processes, which resolve difficulties in model selection and inference caused by varying numbers of objects.
*   [Infinite Hidden Relational Models](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.5555/3020419.3020485) - ***UAI'06***, 2006. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2143172296528388141)]. \[[Preprint](https://www.dbs.ifi.lmu.de/~yu_k/uai06_relation.pdf)]. Relational learning analyzes the probabilistic constraints between the attributes of entities and relationships. This work extends the expressiveness of relational models by introducing for each entity (or object) an infinite-dimensional latent variable as part of a Dirichlet process (DP) mixture model. This work discusses inference in the model, which is based on a DP Gibbs sampler, i.e., the Chinese restaurant process. The authors extended the Chinese restaurant process to be applicable to relational modeling.

### Bayesian Modeling / Bayesian Optimization

*   [Taking the Human Out of the Loop: A Review of Bayesian Optimization](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7352306) - ***Proceedings of the IEEE***, 2015. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2039456143890648437)]. \[[Preprint](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~rpa/pubs/shahriari2016loop.pdf)]. Big Data applications are typically associated with systems involving large numbers of users, massive complex software systems, and large-scale heterogeneous computing and storage architectures. The construction of such systems involves many distributed design choices. The end products (e.g., recommendation systems, medical analysis tools, real-time game engines, speech recognizers) thus involve many tunable configuration parameters. These parameters are often specified and hard-coded into the software by various developers or teams. If optimized jointly, these parameters can result in significant improvements. Bayesian optimization is a powerful tool for the joint optimization of design choices that is gaining great popularity in recent years. It promises greater automation so as to increase both product quality and human productivity. This review paper introduces Bayesian optimization, highlights some of its methodological aspects, and showcases a wide range of applications.
*   [Practical Bayesian Optimization of Machine Learning Algorithms](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2012/hash/05311655a15b75fab86956663e1819cd-Abstract.html) - ***NeurIPS'12***, 2012. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14442949298925775705)]. The use of machine learning algorithms frequently involves careful tuning of learning parameters and model hyperparameters. Unfortunately, this tuning is often a ‚Äúblack art‚Äù requiring expert experience, rules of thumb, or sometimes brute-force search. There is therefore great appeal for automatic approaches that can optimize the performance of any given learning algorithm to the problem at hand. This work considers this problem through the framework of Bayesian optimization, in which a learning algorithm‚Äôs generalization performance is modeled as a sample from a Gaussian process (GP). The authors show that certain choices for the nature of the GP, such as the type of kernel and the treatment of its hyperparameters, can play a crucial role in obtaining a good optimizer that can achieve expert-level performance. The authors describe new algorithms that take into account the variable cost (duration) of learning algorithm experiments and that can leverage the presence of multiple cores for parallel experimentation. These proposed algorithms improve on previous automatic procedures and can reach or surpass human expert-level optimization for many algorithms including Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Structured SVMs and convolutional neural networks.
