## [6. Awesome Agi Cocosci](/content/YuzheSHI/awesome-agi-cocosci/week/README.md)

### Domain Specific Language / Logic DSL Applications

*   [LogSay: An Efficient Comprehension System for Log Numerical Reasoning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10494680) - ***IEEE Transactions on Computers***, 2024. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17053857493674669692)]. With the growth of smart systems and applications, high volume logs are generated that record important data for system maintenance. System developers are usually required to analyze logs to track the status of the system or applications. Therefore, it is essential to find the answers in large-scale logs when they have some questions. This work designs a multi-step “Retriever-Reader” question-answering system, namely LogSay, which aims at predicting answers accurately and efficiently. The proposed system can not only answers simple questions, such as a segment log or span, but also can answer complex logical questions through numerical reasoning. LogSay has two key components: Log Retriever and Log Reasoner, and the authors designed five operators to implement them. Log Retriever aims at retrieving some relevant logs based on a question. Then, Log Reasoner performs numerical reasoning to infer the final answer. In addition, due to the lack of available question-answering datasets for system logs, the authors constructed question-answering datasets based on three public log datasets and will make them publicly available. The evaluation results show that LogSay outperforms the state-of-the-art works in terms of accuracy and efficiency.
