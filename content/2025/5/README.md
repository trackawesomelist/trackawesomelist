## [10. Awesome Agi Cocosci](/content/YuzheSHI/awesome-agi-cocosci/week/README.md)

### Bayesian Modeling / Generative Model

*   [Object Perception as Bayesian Inference](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev.psych.55.090902.142005) - ***Annual Review of Psychology***, 2004. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1611451804975333652)]. \[[Preprint](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~ayuille/pubs/ucla/A189_dkersten_ARP2004.pdf)]. We perceive the shapes and material properties of objects quickly and reliably despite the complexity and objective ambiguities of natural images. Typical images are highly complex because they consist of many objects embedded in background clutter. Moreover, the image features of an object are extremely variable and ambiguous owing to the effects of projection, occlusion, background clutter, and illumination. The very success of everyday vision implies neural mechanisms, yet to be understood, that discount irrelevant information and organize ambiguous or noisy local image features into objects and surfaces. Recent work in Bayesian theories of visual perception has shown how complexity may be managed and ambiguity resolved through the task-dependent, probabilistic integration of prior object knowledge with image features.
*   [Image segmentation by data-driven markov chain monte carlo](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1000239) - ***IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence***, 2002. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3461400072144667491)]. \[[Preprint](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~sczhu/papers/DDMCMC_reprint.pdf)]. This paper presents a computational paradigm called Data-Driven Markov Chain Monte Carlo (DDMCMC) for image segmentation in the Bayesian statistical framework. The paper contributes to image segmentation in four aspects. First, it designs efficient and well-balanced Markov Chain dynamics to explore the complex solution space and, thus, achieves a nearly global optimal solution independent of initial segmentations. Second, it presents a mathematical principle and a K-adventurers algorithm for computing multiple distinct solutions from the Markov chain sequence and, thus, it incorporates intrinsic ambiguities in image segmentation. Third, it utilizes data-driven (bottom-up) techniques, such as clustering and edge detection, to compute importance proposal probabilities, which drive the Markov chain dynamics and achieve tremendous speedup in comparison to the traditional jump-diffusion methods. Fourth, the DDMCMC paradigm provides a unifying framework in which the role of many existing segmentation algorithms, such as, edge detection, clustering, region growing, split-merge, snake/balloon, and region competition, are revealed as either realizing Markov chain dynamics or computing importance proposal probabilities. Thus, the DDMCMC paradigm combines and generalizes these segmentation methods in a principled way.
*   [A generative vision model that trains with high data efficiency and breaks text-based CAPTCHAs](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.aag2612) - ***Science***, 2017. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1478382321633671444)]. \[[Preprint](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~ayuille/JHUcourses/ProbabilisticModelsOfVisualCognition2020/Lec22/GeorgeCAPCHAS.pdf)]. Learning from a few examples and generalizing to markedly different situations are capabilities of human visual intelligence that are yet to be matched by leading machine learning models. By drawing inspiration from systems neuroscience, this work introduces a probabilistic generative model for vision in which message-passing–based inference handles recognition, segmentation, and reasoning in a unified way. The model demonstrates excellent generalization and occlusion-reasoning capabilities and outperforms deep neural networks on a challenging scene text recognition benchmark while being 300-fold more data efficient. In addition, the model fundamentally breaks the defense of modern text-based CAPTCHAs (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) by generatively segmenting characters without CAPTCHA-specific heuristics.

### Science Logology / AI Assisted Research

*   [PatCID: an open-access dataset of chemical structures in patent documents](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50779-y) - ***Nature Communications***, 2024. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=329287456191953845)]. The automatic analysis of patent publications has potential to accelerate research across various domains, including drug discovery and material science. Within patent documents, crucial information often resides in visual depictions of molecule structures. PatCID (Patent-extracted Chemical-structure Images database for Discovery) allows to access such information at scale. It enables users to search which molecules are displayed in which documents. PatCID contains 81M chemical-structure images and 14M unique chemical structures. This work compares PatCID with state-of-the-art chemical patent-databases. On a random set, PatCID retrieves 56.0% of molecules, which is higher than automatically-created databases, Google Patents (41.5%) and SureChEMBL (23.5%), as well as manually-created databases, Reaxys (53.5%) and SciFinder (49.5%). Leveraging state-of-the-art methods of document understanding, PatCID high-quality data outperforms currently available automatically-generated patent-databases. PatCID even competes with proprietary manually-created patent-databases. This enables promising applications for automatic literature review and learning-based molecular generation methods.
