## [1. Awesome Agi Cocosci](/content/YuzheSHI/awesome-agi-cocosci/README.md)

### Concepts / Human Concept Representation

*   [Structuring Knowledge with Cognitive Maps and Cognitive Graphs](https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613\(20\)30250-3) - ***Trends in Cognitive Sciences***, 2021. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7196012353183004425)]. \[[Preprint](https://www.sas.upenn.edu/psych/epsteinlab/pdfs/Peer%20Brunec%20Newcombe%20Epstein%20TiCS%202020%20Cog%20maps%20and%20cog%20graphs.pdf)]. Humans and animals use mental representations of the spatial structure of the world to navigate. The classical view is that these representations take the form of Euclidean cognitive maps, but alternative theories suggest that they are cognitive graphs consisting of locations connected by paths. The authors review evidence suggesting that both map-like and graph-like representations exist in the mind/brain that rely on partially overlapping neural systems. Maps and graphs can operate simultaneously or separately, and they may be applied to both spatial and nonspatial knowledge. By providing structural frameworks for complex information, cognitive maps and cognitive graphs may provide fundamental organizing schemata that allow us to navigate in physical, social, and conceptual spaces.
