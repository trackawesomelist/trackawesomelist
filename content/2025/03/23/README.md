## [1. Awesome Agi Cocosci](/content/YuzheSHI/awesome-agi-cocosci/README.md)

### Domain Specific Language / Design Theory

*   [Domain-Specific Modeling Languages: Requirements Analysis and Design Guidelines](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-36654-3_6) - ***Domain Engineering: Product Lines, Languages, and Conceptual Models***, 2013. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=15620404537599157753)]. In recent years, the development of domain-specific modeling languages has gained remarkable attention. This is for good reasons. A domain-specific modeling language incorporates concepts that represent domain-level knowledge. Hence, systems analysts are not forced to reconstruct these concepts from scratch. At the same time, domain-specific modeling languages contribute to model integrity, because they include already constraints that would otherwise have to be added manually. Even though there has been a considerable amount of research on developing and using domain-specific modeling languages, there is still lack of comprehensive methods to guide the design of these languages. With respect to the complexity and risk related to developing a domain-specific modeling language, this is a serious shortfall. This chapter is aimed at a contribution to filling the gap. At first, it presents guidelines for selecting a metamodeling language. Its main focus is on supporting the process from analyzing requirements to specifying and evaluating a domain-specific modeling language.
