## [3. Awesome Agi Cocosci](/content/YuzheSHI/awesome-agi-cocosci/week/README.md)

### Concepts / Human Concept Representation

*   [Organizing conceptual knowledge in humans with a gridlike code](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.aaf0941) - ***Science***, 2016. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=10995575332310321503)]. \[[Preprint](http://behavioralhealth2000.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Organizing-conceptual-knowledge-in-humans-with-a-gridlike-code.pdf)]. It has been hypothesized that the brain organizes concepts into a mental map, allowing conceptual relationships to be navigated in a manner similar to that of space. Grid cells use a hexagonally symmetric code to organize spatial representations and are the likely source of a precise hexagonal symmetry in the functional magnetic resonance imaging signal. Humans navigating conceptual two-dimensional knowledge showed the same hexagonal signal in a set of brain regions markedly similar to those activated during spatial navigation. This gridlike signal is consistent across sessions acquired within an hour and more than a week apart. This work's findings suggest that global relational codes may be used to organize nonspatial conceptual representations and that these codes may have a hexagonal gridlike pattern when conceptual knowledge is laid out in two continuous dimensions.
