## [17. Awesome Agi Cocosci](/content/YuzheSHI/awesome-agi-cocosci/week/README.md)

### Domain Specific Language / Design Practises

*   [Abstract Hardware Grounding Towards the Automated Design of Automation Systems](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-96-0780-8_9) - ***ICIRA'24***, 2024. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3331524500088540378)]. Crafting automation systems tailored for specific domains requires aligning the space of human experts‚Äô semantics with the space of robot executable actions, and scheduling the required resources and system layout accordingly. Regrettably, there are three major gaps, fine-grained domain-specific knowledge injection, heterogeneity between human knowledge and robot instructions, and diversity of users‚Äô preferences, resulting automation system design a case-by-case and labour-intensive effort, thus hindering the democratization of automation. This work refers to this challenging alignment as the abstract hardware grounding problem, where the authors firstly regard the procedural operations in humans‚Äô semantics space as the abstraction of hardware requirements, then the authors ground such abstractions to instantiated hardware devices, subject to constraints and preferences in the real world‚Äîoptimizing this problem is essentially standardizing and automating the design of automation systems. On this basis, this work develops an automated design framework in a hybrid data-driven and principle-derived fashion. Results on designing self-driving laboratories for enhancing experiment-driven scientific discovery suggest the proposed framework‚Äôs potential to produce compact systems that fully satisfy domain-specific and user-customized requirements with no redundancy.

### Domain Specific Language / DSL Program Synthesis

*   [Expert-level protocol translation for self-driving labs](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2024/hash/54dd9e0cff6d9214e20d97eb2a3bae49-Abstract-Conference.html) - ***NeurIPS'24***, 2024. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13997597682274906943)]. \[[Project](https://autodsl.org/procedure/papers/neurips24shi.html)]. Recent development in Artificial Intelligence (AI) models has propelled their application in scientific discovery, but the validation and exploration of these discoveries require subsequent empirical experimentation. The concept of self-driving laboratories promises to automate and thus boost the experimental process following AI-driven discoveries. However, the transition of experimental protocols, originally crafted for human comprehension, into formats interpretable by machines presents significant challenges, which, within the context of specific expert domain, encompass the necessity for structured as opposed to natural language, the imperative for explicit rather than tacit knowledge, and the preservation of causality and consistency throughout protocol steps. Presently, the task of protocol translation predominantly requires the manual and labor-intensive involvement of domain experts and information technology specialists, rendering the process time-intensive. To address these issues, this work proposes a framework that automates the protocol translation process through a three-stage workflow, which incrementally constructs Protocol Dependence Graphs (PDGs) that approach structured on the syntax level, completed on the semantics level, and linked on the execution level. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations have demonstrated its performance at par with that of human experts, underscoring its potential to significantly expedite and democratize the process of scientific discovery by elevating the automation capabilities within self-driving laboratories.
