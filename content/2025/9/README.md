## [2. Awesome Agi Cocosci](/content/YuzheSHI/awesome-agi-cocosci/week/README.md)

### Domain Specific Language / Design Practises

*   [Abstract Hardware Grounding Towards the Automated Design of Automation Systems](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-96-0780-8_9) - ***ICIRA'24***, 2024. \[[All Versions](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3331524500088540378)]. Crafting automation systems tailored for specific domains requires aligning the space of human experts‚Äô semantics with the space of robot executable actions, and scheduling the required resources and system layout accordingly. Regrettably, there are three major gaps, fine-grained domain-specific knowledge injection, heterogeneity between human knowledge and robot instructions, and diversity of users‚Äô preferences, resulting automation system design a case-by-case and labour-intensive effort, thus hindering the democratization of automation. This work refers to this challenging alignment as the abstract hardware grounding problem, where the authors firstly regard the procedural operations in humans‚Äô semantics space as the abstraction of hardware requirements, then the authors ground such abstractions to instantiated hardware devices, subject to constraints and preferences in the real world‚Äîoptimizing this problem is essentially standardizing and automating the design of automation systems. On this basis, this work develops an automated design framework in a hybrid data-driven and principle-derived fashion. Results on designing self-driving laboratories for enhancing experiment-driven scientific discovery suggest the proposed framework‚Äôs potential to produce compact systems that fully satisfy domain-specific and user-customized requirements with no redundancy.
