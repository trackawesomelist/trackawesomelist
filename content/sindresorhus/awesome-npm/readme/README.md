## Tips

### Update to the latest npm version

    $ npm install --global npm

*[Windows users, read more. (⭐2.5k)](https://github.com/felixrieseberg/npm-windows-upgrade)*

### Command aliases

*   `npm i ` → `npm install`
*   `npm i -D` → `npm install --save-dev`
*   `npm t` → `npm test`
*   `npm it` → `npm install && npm test`
*   `npm r` → `npm uninstall`
*   `npm un` → `npm uninstall`
*   `npm up` → `npm update`

### Shell aliases

Speed up your common npm tasks.

In your `.zshrc`/`.bashrc`:

```sh
alias ni='npm install'
alias nid='npm install --save-dev'
alias nig='npm install --global'
alias nt='npm test'
alias nit='npm install && npm test'
alias nk='npm link'
alias nr='npm run'
alias ns='npm start'
alias nf='npm cache clean && rm -rf node_modules && npm install'
alias nlg='npm list --global --depth=0'
```

### Don't add to package.json when installing

By default npm adds packages you install to the `dependencies` field in package.json (since v5). You can prevent this by specifying the `--no-save` flag. You can add a package to `devDependencies` with `--save-dev`/`-D`:

    $ npm install --save-dev ava

### Run scripts

You can easily [run scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/run-script) using npm by adding them to the `"scripts"` field in package.json and run them with `npm run <script-name>`. Run `npm run` to see available scripts. Binaries of locally install packages are made available in the [PATH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_\(variable\)), so you can run them by name.

```json
{
	"name": "awesome-package",
	"scripts": {
		"cat": "cat-names"
	},
	"dependencies": {
		"cat-names": "^1.0.0"
	}
}
```

    $ npm run cat
    Max

All package.json properties are [exposed](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts#packagejson-vars) as environment variables:

```json
{
	"name": "awesome-package",
	"scripts": {
		"name": "echo $npm_package_name"
	}
}
```

    $ npm run name
    awesome-package

#### Passing options to commands

You can pass options to the command you are using in your npm script by adding `-- --flag` like in the example below. The `--` [marks the end of options parsing](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/11376/what-does-double-dash-mean-also-known-as-bare-double-dash), so `npm run` will just ignore it and pass it to the command.

```json
{
	"name": "awesome-package",
	"scripts": {
		"xo": "xo",
		"xo:fix": "npm run xo -- --fix",
	}
}
```

*Adding the `-- --fix ` option is like executing `xo --fix`*.

#### Silent option

`npm run` has a `--silent` option which is especially useful when combining npm scripts.

Imagine you have a setup for linting your JavaScript files like the following:

```json
{
	"name": "awesome-package",
	"scripts": {
		"xo": "xo",
		"xo:fix": "npm run xo --silent -- --fix",
	}
}
```

*Using the `--silent` option reduces the output in the terminal. See [this comparison](https://twitter.com/mkuehnel/status/957965749473210369).*

### Lifecycle scripts

npm comes with predefined [lifecyle scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts) which are excuted under specific conditions if they are defined in your package.json.

```json
{
	"name": "awesome-package",
	"scripts": {
		"prepublishOnly": "nsp check"
	},
	"devDependencies": {
		"nsp": "^3.0.0"
	}
}
```

This will be executed automatically before your npm package is published to the registry via `npm publish` to check for known vulnerabilties in your dependencies.

*Note: **prepublishOnly** is available since npm v4.0.0. See [npm docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts#deprecation-note).*

#### `npm start` and `npm test`

`npm start` and `npm test` are also lifecycle scripts but are not executed automatically.

```json
{
	"name": "awesome-package",
	"scripts": {
		"start": "node server.js",
		"test": "ava"
	},
	"devDependencies": {
		"ava": "^1.0.0"
	}
}
```

Therefore they can be executed simply with:

```console
$ npm test
$ npm start
```

#### `pre` and `post` scripts

These are special lifecycle scripts which can be used to run scripts automatically in sequence.

```json
{
	"name": "awesome-package",
	"scripts": {
		"pretest": "eslint .",
		"test": "ava"
	},
	"devDependencies": {
		"eslint": "^4.19.0",
		"ava": "^1.0.0"
	}
}
```

```console
$ npm test
```

This will lint your files before running your tests. The tests will not run if linting fails. Or more generally spoken: the following script won’t be executed if one of the scripts running in sequence exits with an exit code other than 0.

*Note: `pre` and `post` scripts can also be used for your custom npm scripts. So `npm run foo` will also run `prefoo` and `postfoo` if defined.*

### Run script with `npx`

`npm` [comes bundled](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b) with `npx` (Since v5.2.0) — a tool to execute package binaries. Each command is executed either from the local `node_modules/.bin` directory, or from a central cache, installing any packages needed in order for `<command>` to run.

```json
{
	"name": "awesome-package",
	"dependencies": {
		"cat-names": "^1.0.0"
	}
}
```

If the binary is already installed, it will be executed from `node_modules/.bin`.

    $ npx cat-names
    Max

But if the binary is missing, it will be installed first.

    $ npx dog-names
    npx: installed 46 in 3.136s
    Bentley

### Run commands with different Node.js versions

With `npx` (Comes bundled with npm v5.2.0 or newer) and the [`node-bin`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-bin) package, you can easily try out code in different Node.js versions without having to use a version manager like [`nvm`](http://nvm.sh), [`nave`](https://github.com/isaacs/nave), or [`n`](https://github.com/tj/n).

    $ npx --package=node-bin@6.11.0 -- node --version
    v6.11.0

### Link local packages

Sometimes it can be useful to have a local version of a package as a dependency. You can use `npm link` to link one local package into another. Run `npm link` in the package you want to use. This creates a global reference. Then go into your original package and run `npm link <package-name>` to link in the other package.

    $ cd rainbow
    $ npm link
    $ cd ../unicorn
    $ npm link rainbow

You can now use `rainbow` as a dependency in the `unicorn` package.

### Install a package from GitHub

npm supports using a shorthand for installing a package directly from a GitHub repo:

    $ npm install sindresorhus/chalk

Let's target a specific commit as the main branch is a moving target:

    $ npm install 'sindresorhus/chalk#51b8f32'

Specify either a commit SHA, branch, tag, or nothing.

You can also install Git dependencies with semver: *(Requires npm v5 or newer)*

    $ npm install 'sindresorhus/chalk#semver:^2.0.0'

### Install a specific version of a package

    $ npm install chalk@1.0.0

### List top-level installed packages and their version

    $ npm ls --depth=0

### Command help

Get help docs for a command:

    $ npm help <command>

Example:

    $ npm help install

### Standalone version of a package

Quickly get a standalone version of a package that is browserified and usable in the browser.

    https://wzrd.in/standalone/<package-name>[@<version>]

Examples:

*   <https://wzrd.in/standalone/object-assign>
*   <https://wzrd.in/standalone/object-assign@4.0.0>

Great for prototyping, but download the file or use Browserify yourself for production.
