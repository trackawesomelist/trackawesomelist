### Git-Flow

## Git-Flow

Improved [Git-flow (‚≠ê5.4k)](https://github.com/petervanderdoes/gitflow-avh)

### Index

<hr>

### Setup

###### You need a working git installation as prerequisite. Git flow works on OSX, Linux and Windows.

##### OSX Homebrew:

    $ brew install git-flow-avh

##### OSX Macports:

    $ port install git-flow

##### Linux (Debian-based):

    $ sudo apt-get install git-flow

##### Windows (Cygwin):

###### You need wget and util-linux to install git-flow.

```bash
$ wget -q -O - --no-check-certificate https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petervanderdoes/gitflow/develop/contrib/gitflow-installer.sh install <state> | bash
```

<hr>

### Getting Started

###### Git flow needs to be initialized in order to customize your project setup. Start using git-flow by initializing it inside an existing git repository:

##### Initialize:

###### You'll have to answer a few questions regarding the naming conventions for your branches. It's recommended to use the default values.

```shell
git flow init
```

OR

###### To use default

```shell
git flow init -d
```

<hr>

### Features

###### Develop new features for upcoming releases. Typically exist in developers repos only.

##### Start a new feature:

###### This action creates a new feature branch based on 'develop' and switches to it.

    git flow feature start MYFEATURE

##### Finish up a feature:

###### Finish the development of a feature. This action performs the following:

###### 1) Merged MYFEATURE into 'develop'.

###### 2) Removes the feature branch.

###### 3) Switches back to 'develop' branch

    git flow feature finish MYFEATURE

##### Publish a feature:

###### Are you developing a feature in collaboration? Publish a feature to the remote server so it can be used by other users.

    git flow feature publish MYFEATURE

##### Getting a published feature:

###### Get a feature published by another user.

    git flow feature pull origin MYFEATURE

##### Tracking a origin feature:

###### You can track a feature on origin by using

    git flow feature track MYFEATURE

<hr>

### Make a Release

###### Support preparation of a new production release. Allow for minor bug fixes and preparing meta-data for a release

##### Start a release:

###### To start a release, use the git flow release command. It creates a release branch created from the 'develop' branch. You can optionally supply a \[BASE] commit sha-1 hash to start the release from. The commit must be on the 'develop' branch.

    git flow release start RELEASE [BASE]

###### It's wise to publish the release branch after creating it to allow release commits by other developers. Do it similar to feature publishing with the command:

    git flow release publish RELEASE

###### (You can track a remote release with the: `git flow release track RELEASE` command)

##### Finish up a release:

###### Finishing a release is one of the big steps in git branching. It performs several actions:

###### 1) Merges the release branch back into 'master'

###### 2) Tags the release with its name

###### 3) Back-merges the release into 'develop'

###### 4) Removes the release branch

    git flow release finish RELEASE

###### Don't forget to push your tags with `git push --tags`

<hr>

### Hotfixes

###### Hotfixes arise from the necessity to act immediately upon an undesired state of a live production version. May be branched off from the corresponding tag on the master branch that marks the production version.

##### Git flow hotfix start:

###### Like the other git flow commands, a hotfix is started with

    $ git flow hotfix start VERSION [BASENAME]

###### The version argument hereby marks the new hotfix release name. Optionally you can specify a basename to start from.

##### Finish a hotfix:

###### By finishing a hotfix it gets merged back into develop and master. Additionally the master merge is tagged with the hotfix version

    git flow hotfix finish VERSION

<hr>
