## [1. Awesome Recursion Schemes](/content/passy/awesome-recursion-schemes/README.md)

### Introductions

*   [Practical Recursion Schemes](https://jtobin.io/practical-recursion-schemes) -
    Introduction to pattern functors, fix points, anamorphisms, catamorphisms,
    paramorphisms and hylomorphisms, requiring very little prior knowledge.
*   [An Introduction to Recursion Schemes](http://blog.sumtypeofway.com/an-introduction-to-recursion-schemes/) -
    Three-part series in which you discover recursion schemes from scratch and
    implement a small subset of Edward Kmett's library.
*   [Understanding Algebras](https://www.schoolofhaskell.com/user/bartosz/understanding-algebras) -
    Bartosz Milewski explains F-algebras and shows how to use them in the context of
    catamorphisms.

### Articles

*   [Catamorphisms](https://wiki.haskell.org/Catamorphisms) - Definition on the Haskell Wiki.
*   [Catamorphisms](https://www.schoolofhaskell.com/user/edwardk/recursion-schemes/catamorphisms) -
    Short definition with code on School of Haskell by Edward Kmett.

### Papers / Hylomorphisms in the Wild

*   [Functional Programming with Bananas, Lenses, Envelopes and Barbed Wire, 1991, Meijer et al.](http://maartenfokkinga.github.io/utwente/mmf91m.pdf) -
    The original paper most of this is based on.
*   [A Duality of Sorts, 2013, Hinze et al.](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/ralf.hinze/publications/Sorting.pdf) -
    Shows that many basic sorting algorithms exist as a pair, and that these pairs
    arise naturally out of the duality between folds and unfolds.
*   [Sorting with Bialgebras and Distributive Laws, 2012, Hinze et al.](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/daniel.james/sorting/sorting.pdf) -
    Shows how paramorphisms and apomorphisms can be used for more efficient
    implementations of sorting algorithms.

### Presentations / Hylomorphisms in the Wild

*   [Slidedecks by Tim Philip Williams](http://www.timphilipwilliams.com/slides.html) -
    "Recursion Schemes by Example" and "Exotic Tools for Exotic Trades" provide
    concise definitions as well as practical examples of many recursion schemes.
*   [Unifying Structured Recursion Schemes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EGYSb9vov8) -
    12 min presentation by Ralf Hinze, Nicolas Wu, and Jeremy Gibbons.
*   [Recursion Schemes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zw9KeP3OzpU) -
    Presented by Tim Williams at the London Haskell meetup.
*   [F-algebras or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Type System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK4SOaAGVfg) -
    Presented by Anthony Burzillo at the NYC Haskell User's Group.
*   [A Gentle Introduction to Recursion Schemes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5A2Amfcir8) -
    Presented by Jean Remi Desjardins at Lambdaconf 2016.
