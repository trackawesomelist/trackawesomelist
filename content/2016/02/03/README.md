### Package Status

*   `Usability` : Does the package do what it says it does? is it easy to figure out? Is the package production-ready and actively maintained (issues/PRs are responded and resolved in a timely manner, and maintenance and testing is at par with Julia release cycles).
*   `Quality` : Does the package have tests? are there lots of bugs? Do you have good documentation? Can it be used in production environments that expect prompt security patches?
*   `Activity` : Should a 3rd party user bother to use your library, or is it really only intended to be used by the package author? Let's say, an experimental "throw-away toy repo" whose development has now been abandoned.
