    *   This course is an introduction to operating system design and implementation. We study operating systems because they are examples of mature and elegant solutions to a difficult design problem: how to safely and efficiently share system resources and provide abstractions useful to applications.
    *   For the processor, memory, and disks, we discuss how the operating system allocates each resource and explore the design and implementation of related abstractions. We also establish techniques for testing and improving system performance and introduce the idea of hardware virtualization. Programming assignments provide hands-on experience with implementing core operating system components in a realistic development environment.

It'll cover the mathematics, but the focus will be on using matrix methods in applications such as tomography, image processing, data fitting, time series prediction, finance, and many others. EE103 is based on a book that [Stephen Boyd](http://stanford.edu/\~boyd/) and [Lieven Vandenberghe](http://www.seas.ucla.edu/\~vandenbe/) are currently writing. Students will use a new language called [Julia](http://julialang.org/) to do computations with matrices and vectors.

    *   The course presents the subject through a series of seminars and labs, which will explore it from its early beginnings, and work themselves to some of the state of the art. The seminars will cover the basics of deep learning and the underlying theory, as well as the breadth of application areas to which it has been applied, as well as the latest issues on learning from very large amounts of data. We will concentrate largely, although not entirely, on the connectionist architectures that are most commonly associated with it. *Lectures* and *Reading Notes* are available on the page.

### Courses / Security

    *   The course will cover a variety of contemporary network protocols and other systems with security properties. The course goal is to give students hands-on experience in using automated tools and related techniques to analyze and evaluate security mechanisms. To understand security properties and requirements, we will look at several network protocols and their properties, including secrecy, authentication, key establishment, and fairness. In parallel, the course will look at several models and tools used in security analysis and examine their advantages and limitations. In addition to fully automated finite-state model checking techniques, we will also study other approaches, such as constraint solving, process algebras, protocol logics, probabilistic model checking, game theory, and executable models based on logic programming.

    *   The Web continues to grow in popularity as platform for retail transactions, financial services, and rapidly evolving forms of communication. It is becoming an increasingly attractive target for attackers who wish to compromise users' systems or steal data from other sites. Browser vendors must stay ahead of these attacks by providing features that support secure web applications. This course will study vulnerabilities in existing web browsers and the applications they render, as well as new technologies that enable web applications that were never before possible. The material will be largely based on current research problems, and students will be expected to criticize and improve existing defenses. Topics of study include (but are not limited to) browser encryption, JavaScript security, plug-in security, sandboxing, web mashups, and authentication.

    *   CS262a is the first semester of a year-long sequence on computer systems research, including operating systems, database systems, and Internet infrastructure systems.  The goal of the course is to cover a broad array of research topics in computer systems, and to engage you in top-flight systems research.  The first semester is devoted to basic thematic issues and underlying techniques in computer systems, while the second semester goes deeper into topics related to scalable, parallel and distributed systems.  The class is based on a discussion of important research papers and a research project.
    *   **Parts**: Some Classics, Persistent Storage, Concurrency, Higher-Level Models, Virtual Machines, Cloud Computing, Parallel and Distributed Computing, Potpourri.
    *   Prerequisites: The historical prerequisite was to pass an entrance exam in class, which covered undergraduate operating systems material (similar to [UCB's CS162](https://cs162.eecs.berkeley.edu/)). There is no longer an exam. However, if you have not already taken a decent undergrad OS class, you should talk with me before taking this class. The exam had the benefit of "paging in" the undergrad material, which may have been its primary value (since the pass rate was high).

    *   Want to learn what makes future web technologies tick? Join us for the class where we will dive into the internals of many of the newest web technologies, analyze and dissect them. We will conduct survey lectures to provide the background and overview of the area as well as invite guest lecturers from various leading projects to present their technologies.
