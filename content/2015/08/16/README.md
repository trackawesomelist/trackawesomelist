*   [unshare](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/unshare.1.html)\
    Run program with some namespaces unshared from parent. Part of the util-linux.
*   [python-nsenter (⭐136)](https://github.com/zalando/python-nsenter)\
    This Python package allows entering Linux kernel namespaces (mount, IPC, net, PID, user and UTS) by doing the "setns" syscall.
*   [butter](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/butter)\
    Python library to interface to low level linux features (inotify, fanotify, timerfd, signalfd, eventfd, containers) with asyncio support.
*   [pyspaces (⭐87)](https://github.com/Friz-zy/pyspaces)\
    Works with Linux namespaces through glibc with pure python.

### Security / Levels of security problems

*   regular application
*   always untrusted -> know it
*   suid bit -> mount with nosuid
*   limit available syscall -> seccomp-bpf, grsec
*   system services like cron, ssh
*   run as root -> isolate via bastion host or vm
*   using /dev -> "devices" control group\
    The following device nodes are created in the container by default.\
    The Docker images are also mounted with nodev, which means that even if a device node was pre-created in the image, it could not be used by processes within the container to talk to the kernel.\
    /dev/console,/dev/null,/dev/zero,/dev/full,/dev/tty\*,/dev/urandom,/dev/random,/dev/fuse
*   root calls -> capabilities (cap\_sys\_admin warning!)\
    Here is the current list of capabilities that Docker uses: chown, dac\_override, fowner, kill, setgid, setuid, setpcap, net\_bind\_service, net\_raw, sys\_chroot, mknod, setfcap, and audit\_write.\
    Docker removes several of these capabilities including the following:\
    CAP\_SETPCAP 	Modify process capabilities\
    CAP\_SYS\_MODULE 	Insert/Remove kernel modules\
    CAP\_SYS\_RAWIO 	Modify Kernel Memory\
    CAP\_SYS\_PACCT 	Configure process accounting\
    CAP\_SYS\_NICE 	Modify Priority of processes\
    CAP\_SYS\_RESOURCE 	Override Resource Limits\
    CAP\_SYS\_TIME 	Modify the system clock\
    CAP\_SYS\_TTY\_CONFIG 	Configure tty devices\
    CAP\_AUDIT\_WRITE 	Write the audit log\
    CAP\_AUDIT\_CONTROL 	Configure Audit Subsystem\
    CAP\_MAC\_OVERRIDE 	Ignore Kernel MAC Policy\
    CAP\_MAC\_ADMIN 	Configure MAC Configuration\
    CAP\_SYSLOG 	Modify Kernel printk behavior\
    CAP\_NET\_ADMIN 	Configure the network\
    CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN 	Catch all\
    uses /proc, /sys -> remount ro, drop cap\_sys\_admin; security modules like selinux or apparmor; some part of this fs are "namespace-aware"\
    Docker mounts these file systems into the container as "read-only" mount points.\
    . /sys\
    . /proc/sys\
    . /proc/sysrq-trigger\
    . /proc/irq\
    . /proc/bus\
    Copy-on-write file systems\
    Docker uses copy-on-write file systems. This means containers can use the same file system image as the base for the container. When a container writes content to the image, it gets written to a container specific file system. This prevents one container from seeing the changes of another container even if they wrote to the same file system image. Just as important, one container can not change the image content to effect the processes in another container.
*   uid 0 -> user namespaces, uid 0 mappet to random uid outside
*   system services like devices, network, filesystems
*   kernel drivers, network stack, security policies
*   general like immutable infrastructure
*   container is ro
*   write to small separate rw nosuid part

### Security / Technologies for security

*   SELinux
*   Cgroups
*   file systems under /sys
*   /proc/sys, /proc/sysrq-trigger, /proc/irq, /proc/bus
*   /dev/mem
*   /dev/sd\* file system devices
*   kernel modules

### Miscellaneous

*   [erld (⭐194)](https://github.com/ShoreTel-Inc/erld) - erld is a small program designed to solve the problem of running Erlang programs as a UNIX daemon.

## [6. Awesome Typescript](/content/dzharii/awesome-typescript/README.md)

### Offline / Other (Plugins || Cross-platform || OSS || Free)

*   :octocat: [Typescript addin for (⭐30)](https://github.com/mrward/typescript-addin) MonoDevelop, SharpDevelop and Xamarin Studio;  a short [review article](http://lastexitcode.com/blog/2015/04/01/TypeScriptSupportInXamarinStudio/)
