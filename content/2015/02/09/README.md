## [6. Htaccess](/content/phanan/htaccess/README.md)

### Rewrite and Redirection / Force HTTPS Behind a Proxy

### Force HTTPS Behind a Proxy

Useful if you have a proxy in front of your server performing TLS termination.

```apacheconf
RewriteCond %{HTTP:X-Forwarded-Proto} !https
RewriteRule (.*) https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI}
```

### Rewrite and Redirection / Alias a Single Directory

### Alias a Single Directory

```apacheconf
RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule ^source-directory/(.*) /target-directory/$1 [R=301,L]
```

### Rewrite and Redirection / Alias ‚ÄúClean‚Äù URLs

### Alias ‚ÄúClean‚Äù URLs

This snippet lets you use ‚Äúclean‚Äù URLs -- those without a PHP extension, e.g. `example.com/users` instead of `example.com/users.php`.

```apacheconf
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{SCRIPT_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^([^.]+)$ $1.php [NC,L]
```

### Security / Deny Access to Hidden Files and Directories

### Deny Access to Hidden Files and Directories

Hidden files and directories (those whose names start with a dot `.`) should most, if not all, of the time be secured. For example: `.htaccess`, `.htpasswd`, `.git`, `.hg`...

```apacheconf
RewriteCond %{SCRIPT_FILENAME} -d [OR]
RewriteCond %{SCRIPT_FILENAME} -f
RewriteRule "(^|/)\." - [F]
```

Alternatively, you can just raise a ‚ÄúNot Found‚Äù error, giving the attacker no clue:

```apacheconf
RedirectMatch 404 /\..*$
```

### Miscellaneous / Switch to Another PHP Version

### Switch to Another PHP Version

If you‚Äôre on a shared host, chances are there are more than one version of PHP installed, and sometimes you want a specific version for your website. The following snippet should switch the PHP version for you.

```apacheconf
AddHandler application/x-httpd-php56 .php

# Alternatively, you can use AddType
AddType application/x-httpd-php56 .php
```

## [7. Awesome Courses](/content/prakhar1989/awesome-courses/README.md)

### Courses / Machine Learning

*   [CS 231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) **Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition** *Stanford University* <img src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4bb.png" width="20" height="20" alt="Assignments" title="Assignments" /> <img src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4dd.png" width="20" height="20" alt="Lecture Notes" title="Lecture Notes" /> <img src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4f9.png" width="20" height="20" alt="Lecture Videos" title="Lecture Videos" />
    *   Computer Vision has become ubiquitous in our society, with applications in search, image understanding, apps, mapping, medicine, drones, and self-driving cars. This course is a deep dive into details of the deep learning architectures with a focus on learning end-to-end models for these tasks, particularly image classification. During the 10-week course, students will learn to implement, train and debug their own neural networks and gain a detailed understanding of cutting-edge research in computer vision.
