### Courses / Introduction to CS

*   [CS 61A](http://cs61a.org/) **Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs \[Python]** *UC Berkeley*  <img src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4f9.png" width="20" height="20" alt="Lecture Videos" title="Lecture Videos" /> <img src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4bb.png" width="20" height="20" alt="Assignments" title="Assignments" /> <img src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4dd.png" width="20" height="20" alt="Lecture Notes" title="Lecture Notes" />
    *   In CS 61A, we are interested in teaching you about programming, not about how to use one particular 	programming language. We consider a series of techniques for controlling program complexity, such as functional programming, data abstraction, and object-oriented programming. Mastery of a particular programming language is a very useful side effect of studying these general techniques. However, our hope is that once you have learned the essence of programming, you will find that picking up a new programming language is but a few days' work.
