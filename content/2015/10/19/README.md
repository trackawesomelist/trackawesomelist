## [3. Awesome Codepoints](/content/Codepoints/awesome-codepoints/README.md)

### Code Points that Affect Others

*   [U+FE0E](https://codepoints.net/U+FE0E) VARIATION SELECTOR-15 - force
    black-*&*-white emoji. If this code point follows an emoji, an explicit
    monochrome rendering of the emoji is requested (if the client supports it).

### Code Points that Affect Others / Breaking and Gluing other characters

*   [U+00A0](https://codepoints.net/U+00A0) NO-BREAK SPACE - force adjacent
    characters to stick together. Well known as `&nbsp;` in HTML.
*   [U+00AD](https://codepoints.net/U+00AD) SOFT HYPHEN - (in HTML: `&shy;`)
    like ZERO WIDTH SPACE, but show a hyphen if (and only if) a break occurs.
*   [U+200B](https://codepoints.net/U+200B) ZERO WIDTH SPACE - the inverse to
    U+00A0: create no space, but allow word breaking.
*   [U+200D](https://codepoints.net/U+200D) ZERO WIDTH JOINER - force adjacent
    characters to be joined together (e.g., arabic characters or supported
    emoji). Apple uses this to compose some emoji like different families.
*   [U+2060](https://codepoints.net/U+2060) WORD JOINER - the same as
    U+00A0, but completely invisible. Good for writing `@font-face` on Twitter.
