## [10. Htaccess](/content/phanan/htaccess/week/README.md)

### Rewrite and Redirection / Redirect an Entire Site

### Redirect an Entire Site

```apacheconf
Redirect 301 / http://newsite.com/
```

This way does it with links intact. That is `www.oldsite.com/some/crazy/link.html` will become `www.newsite.com/some/crazy/link.html`. This is extremely helpful when you are just ‚Äúmoving‚Äù a site to a new domain. [Source](http://css-tricks.com/snippets/htaccess/301-redirects/)

### Rewrite and Redirection / Redirect Using RedirectMatch

### Redirect Using RedirectMatch

```apacheconf
RedirectMatch 301 /subdirectory(.*) http://www.newsite.com/newfolder/$1
RedirectMatch 301 ^/(.*).htm$ /$1.html
RedirectMatch 301 ^/200([0-9])/([^01])(.*)$ /$2$3
RedirectMatch 301 ^/category/(.*)$ /$1
RedirectMatch 301 ^/(.*)/htaccesselite-ultimate-htaccess-article.html(.*) /htaccess/htaccess.html
RedirectMatch 301 ^/(.*).html/1/(.*) /$1.html$2
RedirectMatch 301 ^/manual/(.*)$ http://www.php.net/manual/$1
RedirectMatch 301 ^/dreamweaver/(.*)$ /tools/$1
RedirectMatch 301 ^/z/(.*)$ http://static.askapache.com/$1
```

[Source](http://www.askapache.com/htaccess/301-redirect-with-mod_rewrite-or-redirectmatch.html#301_Redirects_RedirectMatch)

### Rewrite and Redirection / Alias Paths to Script

### Alias Paths to Script

```apacheconf
FallbackResource /index.fcgi
```

This example has an `index.fcgi` file in some directory, and any requests within that directory that fail to resolve a filename/directory will be sent to the `index.fcgi` script. It‚Äôs good if you want `baz.foo/some/cool/path` to be handled by `baz.foo/index.fcgi` (which also supports requests to `baz.foo`) while maintaining `baz.foo/css/style.css` and the like. Get access to the original path from the PATH\_INFO environment variable, as exposed to your scripting environment.

```apacheconf
RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule ^$ index.fcgi/ [QSA,L]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.fcgi/$1 [QSA,L]
```

This is a less efficient version of the FallbackResource directive (because using `mod_rewrite` is more complex than just handling the `FallbackResource` directive), but it‚Äôs also more flexible.
