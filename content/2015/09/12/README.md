### Debug / Omniauth

*   [letter\_opener (⭐3.5k)](https://github.com/ryanb/letter_opener) - Preview email in the default browser instead of sending it.

*   [pry-rails (⭐1.3k)](https://github.com/rweng/pry-rails) - Avoid repeating yourself, use pry-rails instead of copying the initializer to every rails project. This is a small gem which causes rails console to open pry. It therefore depends on pry.

*   [spring (⭐2.7k)](https://github.com/rails/spring) - Spring is a Rails application preloader. It speeds up development by keeping your application running in the background so you don't need to boot it every time you run a test, rake task or migration.
