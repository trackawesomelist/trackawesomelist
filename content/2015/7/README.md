## [13. Htaccess](/content/phanan/htaccess/week/README.md)

### Rewrite and Redirection / Force non-www in a Generic Way

### Force non-www in a Generic Way

```apacheconf
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www\.
RewriteCond %{HTTPS}s ^on(s)|off
RewriteCond http%1://%{HTTP_HOST} ^(https?://)(www\.)?(.+)$
RewriteRule ^ %1%3%{REQUEST_URI} [R=301,L]
```

### Rewrite and Redirection / Force HTTPS Behind a Proxy

### Force HTTPS Behind a Proxy

Useful if you have a proxy in front of your server performing TLS termination.

```apacheconf
RewriteCond %{HTTP:X-Forwarded-Proto} !https
RewriteRule (.*) https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI}
```

### Rewrite and Redirection / Alias a Single Directory

### Alias a Single Directory

```apacheconf
RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule ^source-directory/(.*) /target-directory/$1 [R=301,L]
```

### Rewrite and Redirection / Alias ‚ÄúClean‚Äù URLs

### Alias ‚ÄúClean‚Äù URLs

This snippet lets you use ‚Äúclean‚Äù URLs -- those without a PHP extension, e.g. `example.com/users` instead of `example.com/users.php`.

```apacheconf
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{SCRIPT_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^([^.]+)$ $1.php [NC,L]
```

[Source](http://www.abeautifulsite.net/access-pages-without-the-php-extension-using-htaccess/)

### Security / Deny Access to Hidden Files and Directories

### Deny Access to Hidden Files and Directories

Hidden files and directories (those whose names start with a dot `.`) should most, if not all, of the time be secured. For example: `.htaccess`, `.htpasswd`, `.git`, `.hg`...

```apacheconf
RewriteCond %{SCRIPT_FILENAME} -d [OR]
RewriteCond %{SCRIPT_FILENAME} -f
RewriteRule "(^|/)\." - [F]
```

Alternatively, you can just raise a ‚ÄúNot Found‚Äù error, giving the attacker no clue:

```apacheconf
RedirectMatch 404 /\..*$
```

### Miscellaneous / Auto UTF-8 Encode

### Auto UTF-8 Encode

Your text content should always be UTF-8 encoded, no?

```apacheconf
# Use UTF-8 encoding for anything served text/plain or text/html
AddDefaultCharset utf-8

# Force UTF-8 for a number of file formats
AddCharset utf-8 .atom .css .js .json .rss .vtt .xml
```

[Source (‚≠ê3k)](https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs-apache)

### Miscellaneous / Force Downloading

### Force Downloading

Sometimes you want to force the browser to download some content instead of displaying it.

```apacheconf
<Files *.md>
    ForceType application/octet-stream
    Header set Content-Disposition attachment
</Files>
```

Now there is a yang to this yin:

### Miscellaneous / Prevent Downloading

### Prevent Downloading

Sometimes you want to force the browser to display some content instead of downloading it.

```apacheconf
<FilesMatch "\.(tex|log|aux)$">
    Header set Content-Type text/plain
</FilesMatch>
```

### Miscellaneous / Switch to Another PHP Version

### Switch to Another PHP Version

If you‚Äôre on a shared host, chances are there are more than one version of PHP installed, and sometimes you want a specific version for your website. The following snippet should switch the PHP version for you.

```apacheconf
AddHandler application/x-httpd-php56 .php

# Alternatively, you can use AddType
AddType application/x-httpd-php56 .php
```

    *   Perl, PHP, JavaScript, VisualBasic -- they are often-requested skills for employment, but most of us do not have the time to find out what they are all about. In this course, you learn how to use scripting languages for rapid prototyping, web programming, data processing, and application extension. Besides covering traditional programming languages concepts as they apply to scripting (e.g., dynamic typing and scoping), this course looks at new concepts rarely found in traditional languages (e.g., string interpolation, hashes, and polylingual code). Through a series of small projects, you use different languages to achieve programming tasks that highlight the strengths and weaknesses of scripting. As a side effect, you practice teaching yourself new languages.

    *   Types and Semantics is about designing and understand programming languages, whether they be domain specific or general purpose. The goal of this class is to provide a variety of tools for designing custom (programming) languages for whatever task is at hand. Part of that will be a variety of insights on how languages work along with experiences from working with academics and industry on creating new languages such as Ceylon and Kotlin. The class focuses on types and semantics and the interplay between them. This means category theory and constructive type theory (e.g. Coq and richer variations) are ancillary topics of the class. The class also covers unconventional semantic domains such as classical linear type theory in order to both break students from conventional thinking and to provide powerful targets capable of formalizing thinks like networking protocols, resource-sensitive computation, and concurrency constructs. The class project is to design and formalize a (programming) language for a purpose of the student's choosing, and assignments are designed to ensure students have had a chance to practice applying the techniques learned in class before culminating these skills in the class project.

    *   CS5540 is a masters-level course that covers a wide range of clinical problems and their associated computational challenges. The practice of medicine is filled with digitally accessible information about patients, ranging from EKG readings to MRI images to electronic health records. This poses a huge opportunity for computer tools that make sense out of this data. Computation tools can be used to answer seemingly straightforward questions about a single patient's test results (‚ÄúDoes this patient have a normal heart rhythm?‚Äù), or to address vital questions about large populations (‚ÄúIs there any clinical condition that affects the risks of Alzheimer‚Äù). In CS5540 we will look at many of the most important sources of clinical data and discuss the basic computational techniques used for their analysis, ranging in sophistication from current clinical practice to state-of-the-art research projects.

    *   This course will cover advanced topics in evolutionary algorithms and their application to open-ended computational design. The field of evolutionary computation tries to address large-scale optimization and planning problems through stochastic population-based methods. It draws inspiration from evolutionary processes in nature and in engineering, and also serves as abstract models for these phenomena. Evolutionary processes are generally weak methods that require little information about the problem domain and hence can be applied across a wide variety of applications. They are especially useful for open-ended problem domains for which little formal knowledge exists and the number of parameters is undefined, such as for the general engineering design process. This course will provide insight to a variety of evolutionary computation paradigms, such as genetic algorithms, genetic programming, and evolutionary strategies, as well as governing dynamics of co-evolution, arms races and mediocre stable states. New methods involving symbiosis models and pattern recognition will also be presented. The material will be intertwined with discussions of representations and results for design problems in a variety of problem domains including software, electronics, and mechanics.

    *   CS6452 focuses on datacenter networks and services. The emerging demand for web services and cloud computing have created need for large scale data centers. The hardware and software infrastructure for datacenters critically determines the functionality, performance, cost and failure tolerance of applications running on that datacenter. This course will examine design alternatives for both the hardware (networking) infrastructure, and the software infrastructure for datacenters.

    *   CS6630 is an introduction to physics-based rendering at the graduate level. Starting from the fundamentals of light transport we will look at formulations of the Rendering Equation, and a series of Monte Carlo methods, from sequential sampling to multiple importance sampling to Markov Chains, for solving the equation to make pictures. We'll look at light reflection from surfaces and scattering in volumes, illumination from luminaries and environments, and diffusion models for translucent materials. We will build working implementations of many of the algorithms we study, and learn how to make sure they are actually working correctly. It's fun to watch integrals and probability distributions transform into photographs of a slightly too perfect synthetic world.
