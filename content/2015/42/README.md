## [13. Awesome Codepoints](/content/Codepoints/awesome-codepoints/week/README.md)

### Standalone Code Points

*   The code points of the Unicode blocks [Box
    Drawing](https://codepoints.net/box_drawing) (U+2500 to U+257F) and [Block
    Elements](https://codepoints.net/block_elements) (U+2580 to U+259F) cover
    most of your monospace command-line visualization needs.

          ‚ï≠‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ïÆ
          ‚îÇUnicode‚îÇ
          ‚îÇrules! ‚îÇ
          ‚ï∞‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚ïØ
*   [U+2E2E](https://codepoints.net/U+2E2E) REVERSED QUESTION MARK - the ‚Äúirony
    mark‚Äù to express irony/sarcasm. A useful character‚∏Æ
*   [U+D800](https://codepoints.net/U+D800) to
    [U+DFFF](https://codepoints.net/U+DFFF) - surrogate code points. They are
    only reserved to ease [UTF-16
    encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16).
*   [U+FEFF](https://codepoints.net/U+FEFF) ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE - it‚Äôs name
    suggests, that it can be used like U+2060 WORD JOINER. And in fact the
    latter was introduced to inherit its semantics. This is because U+FEFF had
    become a special beacon called the [byte order
    mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark), that was placed on
    the beginning of some UTF-8 files. In complying software (including many
    text editors) this character is stripped from the start of a file and
    handled as metadata. In non-complying software (like the PHP interpreter)
    this leads to all sorts of fun behaviour.
*   [U+1D455](https://codepoints.net/U+1D455) is missing. It would be an italic
    small ‚Äúh‚Äù. It was not encoded, because it would be identical to the Planck
    constant ‚Ñé ([U+210E](https://codepoints.net/U+210E)).

### Code Points that Affect Others

*   Diacritics and combining marks: There is a [host of
    characters](https://codepoints.net/search?gc=Mn), that add
    to the characters before. Those are called Combining Marks. Unicode
    provides a [handy FAQ](http://unicode.org/faq/char_combmark.html) on the
    details, but in a nutshell: If you add one after a character, it is placed
    on top of that previous one. So, `a + Ãä = √•`. This *may* lead to all kinds
    of funny problems, because for some combinations there are pre-composed
    characters. Our little `√•` here can also be encoded as U+00E5. You might
    note, that while this has a length of one character, the combination of `a`
    and combining ring has a length of two characters.

    Of course, one can also do fun things with those characters like
    [this answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/1732454/113195) on StackOverflow.

### Record Holders and Extremes / Breaking and Gluing other characters

*   [U+1F402](https://codepoints.net/U+1F402) OX - shortest name.
*   [U+FDFA](https://codepoints.net/U+FDFA) ARABIC LIGATURE SALLALLAHOU ALAYHE
    WASALLAM - longest decomposition form: 18 characters.
*   [U+5146](https://codepoints.net/U+5146) and
    [U+16B61](https://codepoints.net/U+16B61) - code points that represent the
    highest ‚Äúsingle-digit‚Äù number. In both cases that‚Äôs 1,000,000,000,000, a
    trillion.
*   [U+0F33](https://codepoints.net/U+0F33) TIBETAN DIGIT HALF ZERO - code point that
    represents the *lowest* ‚Äúsingle-digit‚Äù number and at the same time the
    only negative one, -¬Ω.
*   The trophy for most useless code points goes to
    [U+0080](https://codepoints.net/U+0080),
    [U+0081](https://codepoints.net/U+0081) and
    [U+0099](https://codepoints.net/U+0099). These so-called C1 control
    characters are more or less unspecified. They got into Unicode, because
    they were present in the very first version of what should later become ISO
    10646, the ISO-standardized version of Unicode. They [were meant to be part
    of an upgrade to ISO
    2022](http://unicode.org/mail-arch/unicode-ml/y2015-m10/0050.html), that
    never came to be.

### For Funsies / Breaking and Gluing other characters

*   [U+1680](https://codepoints.net/U+1680) OGHAM SPACE MARK - a space that looks
    like a dash. Great to bring programmers close to madness: `1¬†+¬†·öÄ2 === 3`.
*   [U+037E](https://codepoints.net/U+037E) GREEK QUESTION MARK - a look-alike to
    the semicolon. Also a fun way to annoy developers.
*   [U+1F574](https://codepoints.net/U+1F574) MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT LEVITATING -
    A rather curious character, that only made it into Unicode for its
    appearance in the Webdings font (for reasons of backwards compatibility).
*   [U+1F596](https://codepoints.net/U+1F596) RAISED HAND WITH PART BETWEEN
    MIDDLE AND RING FINGERS - the Vulcan salute. Live long and prosper!
    Ôññ
*   [U+1F918](https://codepoints.net/U+1F918) SIGN OF THE HORNS - Rock on!
    Ô§ò

### For Funsies / Games

*   [Chess figures](https://codepoints.net/U+2654..U+265F).
*   [Card suits](https://codepoints.net/U+2660..U+2667) and even a whole [deck of
    cards](https://codepoints.net/playing_cards) complete with joker and back
    of card.
*   [Die faces](https://codepoints.net/U+2680..U+2685) and a nice [die
    emoji](https://codepoints.net/U+1F3B2).
*   [Go pieces](https://codepoints.net/U+2686..U+2689).
*   [Draughts (or checkers) pieces](https://codepoints.net/U+26C0..U+26C3).
*   [Shogi pieces](https://codepoints.net/U+2616,U+2617,U+26C9,U+26CA), a
    [Japanese variant of chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogi).
*   [Domino tiles](https://codepoints.net/domino_tiles)
*   [Mahjong tiles](https://codepoints.net/mahjong_tiles)
