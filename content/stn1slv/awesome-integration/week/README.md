### Integration Patterns / Microservice API Patterns

*   Foundation
    *   [Frontend Integration](https://microservice-api-patterns.org/patterns/foundation/FrontendIntegration) - How can client-side end-user interfaces that are physically separated from server-side business logic and data storage be populated and updated with computing results, result sets from searches in data sources, and detailed information about data entities? How can application frontends invoke activities in a backend or upload data to it?
    *   [Backend Integration](https://microservice-api-patterns.org/patterns/foundation/BackendIntegration) - How can distributed applications and their parts, which have been built independently and are deployed separately, exchange data and trigger mutual activity while preserving system-internal conceptual integrity without introducing undesired coupling?
    *   [Public API](https://microservice-api-patterns.org/patterns/foundation/PublicAPI) - How can an API be made available to an unlimited and/or unknown number of API clients outside the organization that are globally, nationally, and/or regionally distributed?
    *   [Community API](https://microservice-api-patterns.org/patterns/foundation/CommunityAPI) - How can the visibility of and the access to an API be restricted to a closed user group that does not work for a single organizational unit but for multiple legal entities (such as companies, nonprofit/nongovernment organizations, and governments)?
    *   [Solution-Internal API](https://microservice-api-patterns.org/patterns/foundation/SolutionInternalAPI) - How can access to and usage of an API be limited to an application, for instance, components in the same or another logical layer and/or physical tier?
    *   [API Description](https://microservice-api-patterns.org/patterns/foundation/APIDescription) - Which knowledge should be shared between an API provider and its clients? How should this knowledge be documented?
*   Responsibility
    *   Endpoint Roles
        *   [Processing Resource](https://microservice-api-patterns.org/patterns/responsibility/endpointRoles/ProcessingResource) - How can an API provider allow its clients to trigger an action in it?
        *   [Information Holder Resource](https://microservice-api-patterns.org/patterns/responsibility/endpointRoles/InformationHolderResource) - How can domain data be exposed in an API, but its implementation still be hidden? How can an API expose data entities so that API clients can access and/or modify these entities concurrently without compromising data integrity and quality?
    *   Operation Responsibilities
        *   [State Creation Operation](https://microservice-api-patterns.org/patterns/responsibility/operationResponsibilities/StateCreationOperation) - How can an API provider allow its clients to report that something has happened that the provider needs to know about, for instance, to trigger instant or later processing?
        *   [Retrieval Operation](https://microservice-api-patterns.org/patterns/responsibility/operationResponsibilities/RetrievalOperation) - How can information available from a remote party (the API provider, that is) be retrieved to satisfy an information need of an end user or to allow further client-side processing?
        *   [State Transition Operation](https://microservice-api-patterns.org/patterns/responsibility/operationResponsibilities/StateTransitionOperation) - How can a client initiate a processing action that causes the provider-side application state to change? How can API clients and API providers share the responsibilities required to execute and control business processes and their activities?
        *   [Computation Function](https://microservice-api-patterns.org/patterns/responsibility/operationResponsibilities/ComputationFunction) - How can a client invoke side-effect-free remote processing on the provider side to have a result calculated from its input?
    *   Information Holder Types
        *   [Operational Data Holder](https://microservice-api-patterns.org/patterns/responsibility/informationHolderEndpointTypes/OperationalDataHolder) - How can an API support clients that want to create, read, update, and/or delete instances of domain entities that represent operational data: data that is rather short-lived, changes often during daily business operations, and has many outgoing relations?
        *   [Master Data Holder](https://microservice-api-patterns.org/patterns/responsibility/informationHolderEndpointTypes/MasterDataHolder) - How can I design an API that provides access to master data that lives for a long time, does not change frequently, and will be referenced from many clients?
        *   [Reference Data Holder](https://microservice-api-patterns.org/patterns/responsibility/informationHolderEndpointTypes/ReferenceDataHolder) - How should data that is referenced in many places, lives long, and is immutable for clients be treated in API endpoints? How can such reference data be used in requests to and responses from Processing Resources or Information Holder Resources?
        *   [Link Lookup Resource](https://microservice-api-patterns.org/patterns/responsibility/informationHolderEndpointTypes/LinkLookupResource) - How can message representations refer to other, possibly many and frequently changing, API endpoints and operations without binding the message recipient to the actual addresses of these endpoints?
        *   [Data Transfer Resource](https://microservice-api-patterns.org/patterns/responsibility/informationHolderEndpointTypes/DataTransferResource) - How can two or more communication participants exchange data without knowing each other, without being available at the same time, and even if the data has already been sent before its recipients became known?
*   Structure
    *   Representation Elements
        *   [Atomic Parameter](https://microservice-api-patterns.org/patterns/structure/representationElements/AtomicParameter) - How can simple, unstructured data (such as a number, a string, a Boolean value, or a block of binary data) be exchanged between API client and API provider?
