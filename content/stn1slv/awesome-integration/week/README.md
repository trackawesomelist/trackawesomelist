### Integration Patterns / Microservice API Patterns

*   Foundation
    *   [Frontend Integration](https://microservice-api-patterns.org/patterns/foundation/FrontendIntegration) - How can client-side end-user interfaces that are physically separated from server-side business logic and data storage be populated and updated with computing results, result sets from searches in data sources, and detailed information about data entities? How can application frontends invoke activities in a backend or upload data to it?
    *   [Backend Integration](https://microservice-api-patterns.org/patterns/foundation/BackendIntegration) - How can distributed applications and their parts, which have been built independently and are deployed separately, exchange data and trigger mutual activity while preserving system-internal conceptual integrity without introducing undesired coupling?
    *   [Public API](https://microservice-api-patterns.org/patterns/foundation/PublicAPI) - How can an API be made available to an unlimited and/or unknown number of API clients outside the organization that are globally, nationally, and/or regionally distributed?
    *   [Community API](https://microservice-api-patterns.org/patterns/foundation/CommunityAPI) - How can the visibility of and the access to an API be restricted to a closed user group that does not work for a single organizational unit but for multiple legal entities (such as companies, nonprofit/nongovernment organizations, and governments)?
    *   [Solution-Internal API](https://microservice-api-patterns.org/patterns/foundation/SolutionInternalAPI) - How can access to and usage of an API be limited to an application, for instance, components in the same or another logical layer and/or physical tier?
    *   [API Description](https://microservice-api-patterns.org/patterns/foundation/APIDescription) - Which knowledge should be shared between an API provider and its clients? How should this knowledge be documented?
*   Responsibility
    *   Endpoint Roles
        *   [Processing Resource](https://microservice-api-patterns.org/patterns/responsibility/endpointRoles/ProcessingResource) - How can an API provider allow its clients to trigger an action in it?
        *   [Information Holder Resource](https://microservice-api-patterns.org/patterns/responsibility/endpointRoles/InformationHolderResource) - How can domain data be exposed in an API, but its implementation still be hidden? How can an API expose data entities so that API clients can access and/or modify these entities concurrently without compromising data integrity and quality?
    *   Operation Responsibilities
        *   [State Creation Operation](https://microservice-api-patterns.org/patterns/responsibility/operationResponsibilities/StateCreationOperation) - How can an API provider allow its clients to report that something has happened that the provider needs to know about, for instance, to trigger instant or later processing?
        *   [Retrieval Operation](https://microservice-api-patterns.org/patterns/responsibility/operationResponsibilities/RetrievalOperation) - How can information available from a remote party (the API provider, that is) be retrieved to satisfy an information need of an end user or to allow further client-side processing?

### Resources / Integration Styles

*   [File Transfer](https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/FileTransferIntegration.html) - Data is exchanged through file exchange between applications.
*   [Messaging](https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/Messaging.html) - Applications exchange messages using a messaging infrastructure.
*   [Remote Procedure Invocation](https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/EncapsulatedSynchronousIntegration.html) - Applications call functions or procedures on a remote server over a network.
*   [Shared Database](https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/SharedDataBaseIntegration.html) - Multiple applications access and manipulate the same data through a common database.

### Resources / Protocols

*   [MQTT](https://mqtt.org/mqtt-specification/) - A lightweight and efficient publish-subscribe protocol that supports messaging between devices. MQTT enables low-overhead communication and is ideal for IoT and mobile applications.
*   [SOAP](https://www.w3.org/TR/soap/) - A messaging protocol that uses XML to enable communication between systems. SOAP supports a wide range of messaging scenarios, including distributed computing and enterprise applications.
